Either way, Hillary has attacked Bernie supporters by tell us we are young and don't do our research (I'm actually 41, a federal government employee and I spend my free time studying corruption), she has attacked Greenpeace members when questioned if she would end her ties with fossil fuel companies, but instead of attacking them for their facts she blames Bernie's campaign! Both she and her husband have verbally attacked #BLM members and now she is claiming that VT is responsible for guns in NYC (which has been proven to be false), and even if they were, Senator Sanders is a federal employee and gun laws are made on a LOCAL LEVEL! My question is, how much is she paying and the DNC paying you, as it has come to light that the DNC paid super delegates to pledge their vote to Hillary before the primaries stared and how much are they paying you for this post?  You know I really thought you were getting it when you and Senator Sanders worked together to amend the farm bill to label GMO's but your support of Hillary tells me you don't get it, because if you did you would know that supporting her is supporting GMOs, as she feels companies that produce them should just ""rebrand"" them, so they don't sound so scary. Plus, Hillary has been questioning his qualifications for months and insinuating he is lying to his supporters, and every time she does it the facts come out that she is not being honest!",1
"10154070335838787_2026562060902300",0,"http://usuncut.com/politics/hillary-clinton-gaslighting-sanders/  Hillary Clinton Is Gaslighting Bernie Sanders and It Is Abusive Amanda Girard | April 7, 2016 US Uncut   Hillary Clinton shares a common trait with Donald Trump, establishment media, and mental abusers. That trait is gaslighting.  According to the basic Wikipedia definition, gaslighting is a form of mental abuse wherein “information is twisted or spun, selectively omitted to favor the abuser, or false information is presented” by an abusive person in order to manipulate the accuser into questioning reality. Most commonly, the technique is used by abusers to outright deny any past wrongdoing when confronted for past behavior.  After a feud yesterday in which Clinton questioned Sanders’ qualifications for the presidency and Sanders responded in kind, Hillary Clinton played coy and acted as if she were above the fray. During an interview in New York, Clinton said she would support Sanders if he were the nominee, and suggested he instead direct his attacks on Republicans and “keep our eye on what’s really at stake in this election.”  This is an odd 180 degree turn from Clinton’s post-Wisconsin campaign strategy of promising a scorched-earth primary until the convention. After Clinton’s drubbing in the Wisconsin primary, CNN reported that Clinton’s campaign was seeking to “disqualify and defeat” Sanders ahead of the convention, and put party unity on the back burner.  For starters, Clinton used the 20 children killed in Sandy Hook as a launch pad for attacking Sanders on gun control, which ended up blowing up in her face. She also hinted that Bernie Sanders was a fake Democrat, who was unqualified to run for president. Attacking Sanders apparently wasn’t enough, as Clinton also lobbed patronizing shots at his supporters, saying she felt “sorry” for young people voting for Sanders who “don’t do their own research.”  Furthermore, at the most recent Democratic debate, Clinton accused Sanders of siding with anti-immigrant “minutemen” militias and suggested he was popular with the Koch Brothers. Before that, she tried to claim he was against the auto bailout for Michigan workers during the debate in Flint. ( ... )  Clinton shouldn’t be allowed to squirm her way out of her doublespeak. Gaslighting is a manipulative tactic, and the media should hold her accountable for acting as though her slew of attacks on Sanders never happened.",1

Tell them that sons and daughters came home so that ISIS Coukd rape, murder, torture innocent people , make them slaves, turn children into murderers , kill women and children and all this using the weapons their government left behind as they tucked tail and ran because they couldn't stomach a war anymore which had now caused a refugee crisis equal to that of World War Two and deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people including women and children ! The president of the United States of America and his democrat followers are a bunch of cowards!!! Now they want to give Iran a nuclear weapon which this deal most certainly will either way it's done because our president let the Iranians get most of their nuclear capability under his watch ! As well as funding terrorists groups that attack Israel on a frequent basis sending rockets into Israel ! A bunch of cowards! Russia and China are going to walk all over this president and his flunky followers ! When the graves need to be dug I hope the America people give the shovels to the democrats that supported the Iran deal and make them dig graves just like the soldiers in World War Two did to the Germans that watched as the Jewish people died in the concentration camps! That's his legacy! The president wouldn't take on Syria a little country yet he talks about war with Iran . Syria used chemical weapons and the president said if they did there would be consequences yet the only thing that happened is one of the P5 plus 1 country's started to help the Syrian government who used chemical weapons . Russia is there right now. What's that tell you?Russia is already selling weapons to Iran , China is already selling Iran the ICBM technology . That's two out of 5 of the p5 which are the two strongest country's . They are not going to help either way they are our enemies right now! France and Germany are scared and they need the resources of Iran .  An agreement on paper doesn't mean a damn thing to the Iranians ! Russia is in Syria right now! China , Britain, Germany , none of them tried to stop ISIS and they won't help to stop Iran or help the U.S. At anytime ! Where were they in the UK ? China and the others just want the resources and don't give a damn about America!  Get it through your thick skulls!The Revolutionary guard won't accept the deal even if it's made. That's what they mean! They are going to pursue the nukes anyway and there's nothing no one can do! The deal does t mean a thing! Get ready for world war three on your watch because I'm sure it's coming . Iran has broken every agreement ever made with them!  The Whitehouse rejected the original sanctions in the first place, those sanctions that were put in place because Iran was building the nuclear bomb in the first place! They got to where they are today because of this administrations failure to act and the decorates are a part of it because they stood by the presidents side like puppy's ! So the white house has been on it and side the whole time the negotiations began.I guess some people want to live their lifetimes out before the bombs go off or until they get their bunkers built! Cowards! They knew Iran was building the nukes for years yet they were too much of cowards to do anything about it. Now it's too late they already have it and the capability they are lying when they say they are stopping it! They are actually giving them money hat will be given to Russia and China,the Iranians already tried to buy from Germany as well. Russia and China have the Iranians a line of credit. So really the president , John Kerry and the democrats are supporting Iran and terrorism , which in my opinion is treason. Again Iran was developing nuclear weapons in the first place and that's why negotiations began. As well as the FACT Iran has broke every agreement ever made and that's why there were sanctions in the first place !",1

We so desperately need The Right To Try Act HR3012 of 2015 passed, this Act gives HOPE to terminally ill patients and the Senate/Congress members should support this bill 100% for everyone suffering with ALS. They are given a terminal diagnosis, it should be an American RIGHT to try what medicine you want !! These drugs have already passed level 1 FDA approvals so we know they are safe! Give terminal patients that right! We need this passed on a federal level to catch up with states recognizing the need for this important legislature. More than 25 states have already signed this into effect. We need your support NOW!  #HOPENOW  #CureALS #ENDALS",0

I reside on a small thirty acre farm in Montgomery county. Have been at this location since 1992. Received notice of yet another tax increase for property. Over triple what I currently pay. Why and how can this be? My taxes are going be around 7000 dollars a year. I'm at a loss for words. I choose to live in the country. With increase since I'm disabled from an incident, I was struck by lightning in 2000 I only get a small ss check. I might have to sale my home. Illegal immigrants get better treatment than I get. My insurance covers nothing like it used to and until I pay 6000 in deductibles it pays nothing. Prescription drugs they refuse many doctors want give me from time to time. So everyone's life getts easier mine gets worse. I voted Republicans and you gentleman are as bad as obadman and the dumbocrats. The burden of the tax hike must be stopped. It's not fun being treated so bad by all the political mistakes. Clinton goes it almost broke comes out a multimillion, obadman lies cheats and stills and is going come out a multimillion. He has not lead us but down. Even our supreme court makes laws. You have done nothing. I need you to look I to the state real estate tax hike. Born and raised and worked in Ohio . now sir I need know why and how you and the governor can be so bad as tax me beyond my means. If you had do this then this kind of jump means you guys are spending way to much money.every state worker needs a pay cut. Reduction in benefits and learn get by with less.  I know you'll laugh it off. Say I'm crazy. No sir you and speaker of house are not doing your jobs. To much free fare. I don't understand why you punish me just because I have an old farm house in the country. I get nothing but grief. Sorry I had write this but it hurts to see your dream crumbled because government stole it. Yes big trips taxes pay for, system put in place and my politicians are to affraid to fight for what is right. Tony Hall became a sorry excuse for Congress so we the citizens voted him out. I will stand for you if you do your job and vote to protect the people. If not I will vote against you. So stand for something and make it so many of us don't have to leave our homes because of taxation without representation. I have contacted man that stand with recalling the governor. He messed up with this tax deal and anyone I find involved you need enter back into private life because you are not doing what your taking our tax dollars to do. I've never wrote a letter to a  congress before. I will not be robbed by government with out a fight.",1

I have traveled the world proud of my country although I had nothing to do with being born in America. Knowing that, I found it an humbling reality I was born in America, raised in America and have spent my years primarily located in America. From squatter camps in South Africa to barrios in Brazil, I have seen first hand what awaits many children, parents, and families as they attempt to eek a living, build a house, keep the family secure and well against huge odds. Having said all that, I must say I am sad, embarrassed, and profoundly disappointed in the behavior of citizens in this country during the presidential primary election cycle. As a Christian, I believe deeply that we are sinners without hope and without excuse before God. I do not believe that ""people are basically good."" What we have done in the past as a society is to stay somewhat in the lines of a civil and law abiding society. We have learned(sometimes to excess) how to accommodate and welcome the immigrant, because except for the Native Americans, everyone else is an immigrant from somewhere. Some of our most noble behaviors have been our compassion, generosity, and our help when natural catastrophes and war induced tragedies Having said that, it deeply troubles me that Donald Trump has touched and resonated with the demons of our lower nature. By word and example, he has portrayed for all an unbelievable arrogance, narcissism in the extreme, and incivility to everyone who gets in his way. Working in the prison system brought me face to face with offenders who were full of hate and unable to control their emotions, impulses, or their behaviors. That was largely why they were in prison. However, this man packs out venues and as he spills his vile ""campaign speeches"" Trumpites applaud his diatribes and insults. And then he twitters more after the rally. I am even more disappointed in the Republican Congressional leadership and the Republican representatives and senators who have endorsed this campaign and the campaigner because he is the ""official presumptive candidate. As they endorse, I can only believe they are also endorsing his reprehensible behavior, insults, and spats with media and other leaders of our country. That means they endorse his derogatory comments about women, Hispanics, immigrants, Muslims, Middle Easterners, and several of the Western Leaders with which the US must work closely with. What we have among Republican leadership is a profound lack of moral courage to stand up to this bully. Republicans beat the drum for more interventions around the world, always willing to send some one else's child in harms way. They are willing to attempt to stare down the President. They are willing to tolerate voter frustration with their refusal to hold hearing on a new Supreme Court Justice, but when it comes to standing up to Donald Trump, refusing to support his candidacy because of everything he has said, done, and says he will do if elected. These days are to me one of the saddest periods of American history, because we have few Republican leaders with the moral courage to say, ""No, I will not be a part of allowing the United States to be the laughing stock of the world.""",1

"10153416932628340_10153457502058340",0,"Mr representative: 14Th AMENDMENT CITIZENSHIP CLAUSE MUST BE REPEALED.  If the Latino people become the majority population in the United States , there is no doubt 100% the United States will become another Mexico. face the truth and face the reality. BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO CITIZENSHIP.  From the beginning of 2009 the clamor of so-called immigration reform causes a lot of illegal immigrants into the United States.  Just from 2010 to 2014, the new increase of illegal immigrants has been close to 10 million, coupled with the large number of previously existing illegal immigrants, their impact and damage on American society and economy are long-term and deep-seated, it continues to weaken America’s competitiveness in the international community, because huge amount of national resources are consumed in dealing with the issue of these illegal immigrants, reducing the investment in other more pressing areas. In a couple of illegal immigrants to calculate fertility of five children, 18-years spending to more than 5.4 million dollars, not including the new cost which they and their adult children will produce. Worse, due to the impact of demographic changes on the social forms, Mexico today is the United States tomorrow. In fact, the United States is rapidly toward latinized, and correspondingly, the U.S. economy is severely ill. I once saw a TV program, a reporter interviewed an illegal immigrant with three children, when a reporter asked her what she intended to America, she smirked and said she was happy to meet the border patrol and looking for a job in the future. Short sentence, it illustrates three problems: the first, she knew the border patrol couldn’t simply deport her, only to let them stay; the second, a woman with three children, “looking for a job” how could she work? What she was saying sounded like an idiot, and listen to this idiot words, someone will actually believe she would be “ working hard”,  and ultimately not make Americans pay all expenses for them? The third, even an idiot can drill American Immigration loopholes in law, it seems that America's immigration law enforcement is really a problem. America is a country that is one people one vote, which means the majority ethnic population will occupy a dominant position in the country, the country will approach this ethnic cultures and being administrated in their ways of thinking. That Latino illegal immigrant even does not know how to arrange her own life, but she and her children in the future will come to arrange this country and arrange your life, would you accept it? If the United States is replete with such kind of people, does the United States still have hope? For those Mexicans who born and raised in the United States, even if they speak native English, but they do not have any difference with those Mexicans who only speak Spanish, this is my empirical observation and judgment. Do not tell us that the American social melting pot as like idiot balderdash, people is determined by the genes and DNA, genes and DNA determine the thinking and behavioral characteristics of an organism. River and mountain could be moved, human nature is harder to change. Mexico is a democratic country, they are one people one vote to elect president and members of congress, but in recent decades among the various anti-Americanism wave set off in Mexico, a large number of US companies property and land were confiscated, Mexico also rejected the US government to give them any assistance and reform proposals, please remember this is their choice.  Most people tend to only focus on ""headline news"" of recent economy in the United States , but they tend to ignore some key cause permanent damage to the American economy, and illegal immigrants have caused a heavy financial burden of hundreds billion dollars a year to the United States, these burden are maintained by the U.S. government with unprecedented borrowing and the FED insane level of behavior to print money. From the continued deterioration of the following series of data such as: Civilian Employment-Population Ratio, Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate, Inactivity Rate, Current Account Balance, New One Family Houses Sold, Adjusted Monetary Base, Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Velocity of M2 Money Stock, Federal Debt and Total Public Debt, All Sectors Credit Market Instruments and Liability Level, It all happened from 2009 onwards after a large number of illegal immigrants into the United States, which reflect some of the left-wing political figures in American politics and political agents of illegal immigrants have bragged so-called illegal immigrants can boost the American economy argument is how absurd, vulnerable, proved unfounded and sounds like a fairy tale. Illegal immigrants not only will not boost the U.S. economy, it will give the U.S. economy a permanent damage, and make the United States become another Mexico or Central America country.  U.S. economic data is much worse than five years or even worse than 10 years ago. Even more frightening is that these problems are worsening year by years, long-term negative impact on the U.S. economy will not be repairable.     I call on all Americans at this critical moment, change the fate of the country with your votes, please tell your politicians, THE 14TH AMENDMENT OF U.S. CONSTITUTION ABOUT OUTDATED CITIZENSHIP CLAUSE MUST BE REPEALED, otherwise  you will never have a chance. I really hope that the Democratic Party would support this proposal. I believe this proposal will be able to get support and understanding from Africa Americans, and I also remind the American middle class: do not think you have a certain expertise which can be free from the influence of illegal immigrants, while the overall decline in social situation, your income will also be affected. I do not represent any political party, nor belong to any political faction, I just look for the best interests of the country. Racial theories of the 21st century has a whole new meaning to objectively recognize differences between peoples, rather than standing on the highest point of the so-called morality, regardless of the development of objective facts, blindly laissez-faire. Between the nation and the states we should help each other, but must adhere to the principle, rather than compromise. THE 14th AMENDMENT OF THE U.S.CONSTITUTION ABOUT OUTDATED CITIZENSHIP CLAUSE HAS BECOME THE TERMS OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THE NATIONAL INTERESTS, IT MUST BE COMPLETELY ABOLISHED BY A NEW AMENDMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.",1

The unpalatable arrogance is passe. HILLARY CLINTON is passe.  The Democratic Party these days conjures up images of crusty old men and women covered in cobwebs, tattered lace and mold desperately clinging to the remnants of an era of excess and self-indulgence that is no longer relevant or acceptable. Their positions can no longer be used to enrich themselves, drown out the people's voice, or to spit on us and our needs.  And that is because apathy no longer exists to stunt our dreams and give rise to this culture of greed and excess enjoyed by our politicians. Pandora's box has been opened by BERNIE SANDERS and all the evil has been exposed. It will fly away because it is no longer welcome and when we close that box, so legend has it, only Hope will be left inside.  Our country is run by a bunch of crooks in both Parties. The world is watching and wondering what the hell is going on. We pretend to be the leader of the world, yet do not lead by example, and we clutch at an outdated sense of greatness and glory. Our citizens beg for some leadership, yet none comes. Deaths by guns, poverty and lack of healthcare abound. Add a crumbling infrastructure, education, trade policies, Wall Street banks, unbridled political greed, underhand activity and unbelievable stupidity. And so much more. All we get are pretty speeches, faux tears and a whole lot of Ho Hum moments. Our politicians don't give a stuff about the people they are supposed to represent and our country is one unholy mess as a result.  Our children deserve better. WE deserve better. Our taxes pay these creatures' salaries, but apparently they don't feel they have to work for their money. Try that in any other job, and you'd be out the door. We must be more discerning about who we vote into office in the future.  It is time for this sad, incestuous Party to recognize that its days of unrestrained corrupt behavior are well and truly over. The people are on to their nasty little games, so they can finagle and chicane to their little hearts' content, but it won't change the fact that times are a-changing and values, integrity and compassion are the order of the day.  The old blood, stale air and entitled abuse MUST be expelled from this Party if it is to be relevant and worthy of the American people. It desperately needs to restore dignity and morality to its leadership and finally live up to its name. The dirt that has settled comfortably without challenge for so long must be cleaned out urgently. Otherwise, it will come to an ignominious end VERY SOON.  However, it CAN be saved if BERNIE SANDERS is at the helm. The WORLD wants Bernie, and that is no exaggeration. Indeed, the only people who want Hillary are her tired old crotchety sycophants and uninformed people. Bernie has the people's interests at heart and will attract like-minded people to public office. This means we will, at long last, have a Party we can trust and depend on to serve us. What a concept!  I shall never ever give up my precious vote to Hillary Clinton. Nor should you if you cherish life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If Bernie is not the nominee, I intend to leave this dying Party as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.

If  that is not appalling enough for you, then you are a very jaded  observer of American politics. But, alas, this corruption-in-plain-sight  has become commonplace in American politics. More  cynical still is the absurd Republican argument in favor of an  environmentally damaging project at precisely the moment when the glut  of oil has caused oil prices to plunge—so it really isn't that we need  more oil. No, Mitch McConnell and pals say it's all about jobs. Puh-leaze! Where, one wonders, was this concern about jobs when ""Republicans  blackmail over the debt ceiling"" forced cuts in federal spending that  cost thousands of jobs? ""Oh, and don’t tell me that the cases are  completely different. You can’t consistently claim that pipeline spending creates jobs while government spending doesn’t,"". Just not true. Most sane economists agree that Obama stimulus helped stave off an even higher unemployment rate, and Krugman argues that the recovery that seems underway may in part be due to the fact  that the government on every level has finally stopped slashing spending. ""When the Congressional Budget Office was asked how many jobs would be lost because of the sequester,"" they said, ""the big cuts in federal spending that Republicans extracted in 2011 by threatening to push America into default — its best estimate was 900,000. And that’s  only part of the total loss."" And that alone is more than twice the best estimate for how many jobs the pipeline would create temporarily. Once it's built, there would be very few permanent jobs. Of  course, there is one kind of government spending that Republicans like, and that they agree creates jobs: Military spending. ""When it comes to possible cuts in defense contracts, politicians who loudly proclaim that every dollar the government spends comes at the expense of the private sector suddenly begin talking about all the jobs that will be  destroyed,"" I say, ruefully. ""They even begin talking about the  multiplier effect, as reduced spending by defense workers leads to job  losses in other industries. This is the phenomenon former Representative Barney Frank dubbed 'weaponized Keynesianism.'"" The argument for Keystone XL could be called ""carbonized Keynesianism"". But  if you really want to create jobs—and not simultaneously endanger the  environment—why not opt for investment in American's crumbling  infrastructure? Wouldn't that be a win-win? Conclusion: Ignore jobs claims about Keystone XL. The numbers are tiny, and, ""the jobs argument for the pipeline is basically a sick joke  coming from people who have done all they can to destroy American jobs —  and are now employing the very arguments they used to ridicule  government job programs to justify a big giveaway to their friends in the fossil fuel industry.""",0

Alcee Hastings (D-FL), that condemns the Dog Meat Festival in Yulin, China, and urges China to end the dog meat trade.   During the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, an estimated 10,000 stray dogs and stolen pets are captured, caged, tortured and slaughtered — many just puppies.   The most barbaric aspect of the Dog Meat Festival is that it is the aim of the butchers to cause the animals as much prolonged fear and pain as possible to satisfy ridiculous beliefs and superstitions; so people purchasing the meat will often watch the slaughter wanting to hear to yelps and cries of the animals.  The annual Yulin Festival also leads to many abductions of household dogs, cats and other pets by kidnappers looking to make a quick buck as the festival begins. CNN reports that local animal lovers often try to buy the dogs before the butchers can, but the dog sellers often refuse to sell to the activists.  The good news is that the Chinese government is feeling the pressure to stop the Yulin Festival.  According to media reports, the country has started regulating the dog meat trade, and sales dropped by a third from 2013 to 2014.  We therefore have the Chinese government’s attention on this issue, so another international outcry could save thousands of animals!  I’m sure you must agree, this extreme display of cruelty is despicable, which is why I am asking you to support H.Res. 752, to express the sense of Congress that this horrific and inhumane practice must be stopped.

Just remember that you are merely an employee with a paycheck at the end of the day, and that ultimately in the long run of your success in life, you are easily replaceable because of your decisions of blocking a small chunk of innocent women and children.  What you are committing in truth and reality is supporting a heritage of hate, because hate is not from heritage, meaning that your creating a future of more hate and are creating a more unsafe country nation in which I and my children reside in. That isn't you properly doing your job you have here in this one and only life you will ever have, and in the end you will probably regret how you supported and created a heritage of hate. Because again, hate is not from these refugees as their heritage is Syrian and not hate.  Compassion and being smart is on the surface, and I can see very easily that you are bringing your intelligence down to the level of stupidity because your following the norm instead of thinking in a smart way which would be to allow the mere 10,000 Syrian Refugees in to help coincide and work within this economy thriving. Probably they will work harder than the average drug and alcohol using parents riding off of tax dollars and welfare in public housing to support their unhealthy habits rather than put the needed new shoes and food towards their children because of a lack of values. Where as these Syrian refugees have values from their raising of a heritage in a certain religious structure that believes in earning what is worked for, rather than being given. Which is why they worked so hard carrying their children so far for so many miles to be safe and alive. That shows a lot for what they are willing to do and can help with in our economy through the thriving workforce of the United States with the success rates of our micro and macro economics on a global scale.  Get back the page of thinking smart instead of being a follower acting in a way without thought, because my first impression of you then and is right now would really be that you are not very logical or smart, and are stupid and not capable of leading even yourself in any situation of professionalism.  You need to become a leader, otherwise you have no business being in the position in office that your in and most likely when more violence occurs in the future because of your trying to block these people pledging citizenship to the United States then you wont have your position in office any longer from either yourself resigning from shame, or you being forced to resign because you messed up big time in the future.  Do the smart thing, the leadership thing, which is keeping safe and letting a mere 10,000 people pledge themselves into this country by undergoing the most rigorous background checks of Federal levels that will ever occur yet in history. Because that is you being remembered for making history, and not being forgotten and hated into darkness and oblivion because you messed up big time on this time period by ultimately not keeping this nation as safe as it can be, because you supported a heritage of hate against a certain bloodline of people. We are only one race really, the human race. Together and not separated like how Hitler tried to separate humanity in example. What a stupid guy he was in the end and was killed for his actions and decisions like a loser without any leadership role.  Good luck in either making the right and safe decision of taking in these 10,000 mainly women and children, or messing up by not allowing them in which is not safe for the decades to come when those children grow up hating your children because you chose to hate them. Get smart, get leading, please. Get these people in this country whom are selected and checked out as safe through the extensive federal program created for checking the 10,000 refugee immigrants into the United States.

"967623659942912_968381649867113",4,"I am writing to you as a life-long Democrat, asking you to support HR2646.  I am automatically skeptical of any bill coming from the Republican side of the aisle, but I have been following Senator Murphy’s investigations for the past three years. He listened to families and professionals who deal with the daily fallout of our failed policies,  and I am convinced that this bill contains the  provisions we need to begin to move our dysfunctional system in the right direction. Objections to this bill,  raised in an October 23 letter by a group of Democratic Senators that include you, are based on inaccuracies and misinformation.  I am the mother of a son whose severe bipolar disorder has eroded all semblance of a life of dignity or his ability to function within society. Our family has fought for twelve years to get him into treatment, but our laws put so many obstacles in our path, that we have had to watch helplessly as he deteriorated, lost in a hellish nightmare of voices and delusions. Once a happy and brilliant college student from a stable middle class home, he now sleeps on the heating grates outside the classroom buildings of the elite university where he once attended classes. He has been hospitalized dozens of times but typically held for hours or days, and released with no treatment besides a heavy and indiscriminate dosage of medications aimed at ‘calming agitation’ rather than treating the chronic illness that he has. He is released typically to the streets with a bus pass, with no notice to family because of misapplication of HIPAA laws and with no one to monitor him once he leaves the door of ER. He has been released with serious side effects to medication given to calm him,  because family was not consulted for his history.  The most wrong-headed of the assumptions that have led to the current disastrous state of Mental Health is the idea that the way to protect civil liberties is to withhold treatment to the ill.  Please understand that being able to help people even when they are not able to recognize they need help is absolutely essential. It is the psychotic process  itself which has taken from individuals their freedom and liberty. We are talking about severe disorders of the brain such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, which cause disruption to normal cognitive functioning, and trigger paranoia and delusions. Common sense must tell you that  in the grip of psychosis individuals may not  recognize that an illness is the cause of their experiences. The same mind that is telling you that you are literally god and all events in the world revolve around you, or that psychic entities or the CIA are inserting objects into your body or stealing your thoughts, that same mind is not competent to self-direct medical treatment. Common sense must tell you that. Psychosis is defined as a severe mental disorder in which thought and emotions are so impaired that contact is lost with external reality. And yet we insist that persons so disconnected from reality are able and entitled to make decisions about their own survival. To deny them treatment is not compassion, it is societal neglect. People have a right to treatment, a right to recover the dignity of a life of restored brain health.   Hardest to understand is the resistance to Assisted Outpatient Treatment, which is used everywhere in the developed world with documented success. All the objections you raise are baseless, some based on thoroughly discredited studies. AOT is compassionate, and is only used after voluntary approaches have failed, and for individuals who ALREADY have a history of involuntary  hospitalizations or arrests, so the police and criminal courts are already involved. In contrast, AOT utilizes only civil courts, and no police action. Medication can be prescribed by providers, but never forced. In counties where they have AOT,  incarcerations, emergency hospitalization, homelessness and violence involving those with severe mental illness decrease.  I know you are hearing from groups who oppose HR2646, but please look past the distortions and propaganda, and be aware that this campaign is being orchestrated and paid for by SAMHSA funded organizations: SAMHSA is using  taxpayer money to lobby against federal legislation that would regulate SAMHSA. How is this being allowed to happen? While those with the most severe neurobiological disorders  are left to die on the streets or to deteriorate in our jails, SAMHSA is squandering millions on ‘innovative’ programs for those with ‘mental health challenges’, mild to moderate social or emotional distress, with no accountability. Furthermore, the so-called Recovery Model on which most of these SAMHSA programs are based is profoundly anti-science, anti-psychiatry, and anti-family, denying that mental diagnoses represent  medical conditions, instead relying on long discredited theories that blame schizophrenia and bipolar disorder on childhood trauma.   Families are the frontline of support and sustenance for those with mental illness, but without the support of our institutions and laws we are helpless to protect our loved ones, and our family members become society’s problems- the dangerous or simply deluded lost souls that populate our jails or wander our streets. When tragedies occur, families are the first to get blamed. Please vote for HR2646 without eliminating any of its crucial measures. Please do not allow this bill to fall victim to partisan gridlock or be watered down to irrelevancy.",0

One 17-year-old girl was shot and killed at an overnight party in Oklahoma City, and one 2-year-old girl was shot and killed by her father in an apparent murder-suicide in Wisconsin.  A nine-year-old Florida girl and a Las Vegas teen are in the hospital after being hit in their own homes by celebratory New Year’s gunfire. A 14-year-old Oklahoma boy was shot in the back and is in critical care after he and his friends were ringing people’s doorbells and then running away. (The police are “still determining whether the shooting was justified,” so apparently we’re not sure whether or not a stupid childhood prank that everyone has done at some time in their life now deserves the death penalty.)

There are US veterans going to provide supplies, we ask you to join us.    This is what I shared with Governor Ricketts. Today you talked on your radio show about state police and DAPL in ND. You failed to mention TD has over 300M invested. Also, the information you provided is false based on video and independent reports. Including the UN. So we have NE state troopers inND to defend a corporate investment. This project if completed will pump oil that will make it to the gulf and eventually be sold to SE asia.   Police had created a road block to standing rock which block emergency vehicles and supplies for weeks. Last night a group tried to clear the road. In doing so the police launched incinery device which created a fire on the road. The citizens put the fire out. 5 hours later the police unleashed water cannons, tear gas, concussion grenades and rubber bullets. There are reports of 2 heart attacks, dozens shot with gaping wounds, and many who were tear gassed so intensely the cannot recover control of their bowels. One young 16 year old girl was reported hit with a grenade. The report is here. The misinformation by those with a vested interest seems to be appalling. I would invite you to take a trip with me to standing rock and view our troopers and the actions of those who protect our water.

For example, one state alone has nearly 9,000 boots on the ground for this cause. Our own FDA labels the drugs in horses as unfit for food animals. Currently Bernie is a cosponsor of S.1214, the 114th Congress version of the Safeguard American Foods Export Act. Although 30 Senators and 189 members of the House cosponsor this bill, Bernie is the ONLY Presidential contender to cosponsor it. The bill, although it should be bipartisan, is supported far more by Democrats than Republicans -- a fact that has not gone unnoticed by many Republican horse people who are shifting alliances . So the Republicans, myself included, can look forward to losing a Presidential election because their Congressmen FREQUENTLY underestimate the power of the people to rally around #foodsafety. Some members of the House will undoubtedly lose their seats in November over not cosponsoring H.R.1942, the House version of the SAFE Act #Yes2SAFE",0

News stories about Clinton and Podesta's interest in UFOs have gone viral world wide. However, what the media often fails to mention is Hillary's 20 year interest in the UFO/ET topic and involvement in the Rockefeller Initiative. The late billionaire philanthropist Lawrence Rockefeller engaged the White House during Bill Clinton's Presidency in hopes of disclosing the secret government withheld UFO documents to the public. This was a three year initiative involving members of the cabinet and the First Lady. Since 1993 this has not been spoken of by major news outlets and the candidate herself. It is time media engaged this story, especially since she is aspiring to be our next president and commander and chief. Just last year, Podesta Tweeted that his biggest regret of 2014 was not securing the UFO files for release while he was working in the Obama White House.

We will never! If the Latino people become the majority population in the United States , there is no doubt 100% the United States will become another Mexico, face the truth and face the reality. Mr. Donald Trump recently comments about Senator McCain's personal experiences during Vietnam War, I think some of the media misinterpreted his words of intent. POW has a clear definition in international law of war and Geneva Conventions, when they return to their homes, almost all countries in the world would like to welcome their triumphant return. Mr. Donald Trump is mainly to accuse the inaction of Mr. McCain's tenure in the Senate, and come up with an immigration reform bill to stir up trouble.  Random people speak, each sentence semantics cannot be all very clear and precise, which I think everyone can understand. Take the example of President Obama’s spoke, many of his speeches are others previously written manuscript for him, he was staring at the screen and read to you, or he and others have prepared the outline, and various pre-designed kind of question-answer mode, the camera appears to be very fit, but his point of view you agree with it? Rhetoric is not surprising, the most important is the thought. At this critical moment, we need most is unity, all honorably discharged veterans are the pride of this country.  Mr. President claimed that the Iran nuclear deal was not built on trust, it’s built on verification. In this case, we would require Iran to hand over all nuclear materials rather than two-thirds, destroy all nuclear technical information and equipment, and do not say what they respect the peaceful use of nuclear energy like a pack of lies, the technology needed to build nuclear power plant much higher than a nuclear bomb, that is to say if one day Iran cumulated its technology which can achieve the construction of nuclear power plants, it is equal to it to produce nuclear weapons, countries like Iran's diplomatic relations with the United States it may change at any time, then they can always find an excuse to put forward a nuclear test explosions.  Mr. President’s major promoter of Iran nuclear talks is an Iranian woman----valerie jarrett, who was adopted and grew up in a black Islamic family, such a human what she is thinking every day that I am very clear, so as you mr president: from your staffing assignments is not difficult to see that you are to sprinkle salt at the most sensitive nerve in Americans.  Everything you do is for one purpose: to manufacture a variety of obstacles and resistance in the domestic and international level, knock down  WASP's confidence and weaken their control of society, so as your so-called “liberals” and illegal immigrants political forces came to power in advance to create a social environment and the international environment. Saudi-Arabia has clearly announced that they will also seek nuclear weapons in order to keep up the nuclear balance between Iran, next, all countries can access peaceful nuclear power as an excuse to build nuclear power plants in order to develop nuclear weapons, the United Nations, the NPT will become a piece of paper.     The United States is a mature civil society and a democratic society, so we Americans want Congress to play a more leading role and grasp more power in the political activities of the country. As the president to declare war, he must get authorization from Congress; On immigration policy, any executive orders the president to be issued, he must also obtain a clear and specific congressional authorization, this decision which is based on the special circumstances of the United States and currently facing the grim situation of illegal immigration invasion, to ensure that these most important powers can be firmly in the hands of the American people. The nominations for the Supreme Court justice, we must recognize the fact that, when a case is transferred to the Supreme Court, the root cause of their dispute have not stayed in the judicial interpretation of the terms and cases of these technical level, but on behalf of two different kinds of conflict of social thought, and the verdict of the case will be directly affected by the supreme justice in his education, in which cultural background, ethnicity, religion, personal beliefs of society, more directly speaking, depends on his political position and orientation, politics and law are not completely separated, an inappropriate appointment will result in a series of changes of the entire judicial system judgment tendencies. Thus, through the process of appointing a justice, we American want Congress must pay attention to his previous court cases, to understand and predict his attitude and position on certain important issues, we do not want to see more so-called liberal justices to the Federal Supreme Court. On the diversity topics, whites should be able to get more quotas and opportunities, apart from giving a number of quotas as the special arrangements to African Americans, other minorities cannot take the pretext of so-called diversification to gain any special privileges. In particular, we do not allow illegal immigrants and the agents that they support and cultivate under the banner name of diversification to occupy other people’s opportunities, then drill into the political system of the country and violate national security, as they seek the interests of their illegal activities, we must completely eradicate them at the door. With the influx of illegal immigrants, the United States is facing serious financial burden, fiscal deficits and debt remain high, resulting in the depreciation of US dollar, the real purchasing power of currency every year to continue to decline in the consumer price index has been rising. Thus in order to let US Congressmen and Congresswomen to get more equitable income, in order to mitigate the adverse impact of illegal immigrants brought to their lives,  I recommend giving them a 20% wage increase, thanks to the hard work they have made to the American people. About the war in Iraq, I want to explain the most important thing is: Iraq is not Germany, not Japan, nor South Korea, the difference is at this point, George W. Bush did not see this, so he lost, and his brother Jeb Bush did not see it, so he married a Mexican wife.   It is said that some Hollywood celebrities have always been a fan of left-wing liberal politicians, so let us talk about Hollywood movie today. Hollywood production’s quality is deteriorating in recent decades, I've seen some American 1940s and 1950s movies, that is the real work of art, and the contemporary Hollywood movies in addition to photographic technique with modern technology has made great strides beyond its ideological philosophical, analytical ability of modern society, for the exploration of human nature, of the role of psychological description and characterization are far inferior to the works of a few decades ago. This is not to say that the lack of good contemporary American producers and directors, but they face the audience has changed, as the film industry, they must always face the market, that is to say what kind of audience, what kind of play you need to shoot. Because of the influx of illegal immigrants, the US population structure is undergoing tremendous changes, in appreciation of an audience constantly tend to vulgar idiot surroundings, producers and directors of these films must also be taken cater to this demand, and thus some of the vulgar as a kind of aesthetic standards, the grandstanding as a kind of artistic pursuit, this is the impact of illegal immigration on the US cultural level.",1

He manufactures arrests of homeowners slumming property and later arresting tenants, filing fake lawsuits to personally cash bonds (warrants) with the U. S. Treasury that prisoners and taxpayers receive the bill/sentence, that death penalty sentences are profitable business transactions. Subordinate judges are his employees with no regard to election, that he has unlimited access to emergency systems, and hospitals, and as tools to harm people and to facilitate the theft of babies for sale. He is board members of multiple corporations disguised as government. This man has no law degree/Bar score and his birth name is Kenneth McWhorter, that I met him in 1976, when I was 15 and he was 27, in a Park North Professional Hospital in San Antonio. I have been incarcerated for almost two years in either the Hays County Jail or in the Austin State Hospital by virtue of fraudulent court orders by his hand and 3.5 years out of 5.5 years by him in other counties. I have documented this with Sheriff Gary Cutler. I am supposed to believe there is something wrong with me for refusing entry to his court and that his weapons, in the form of underpaid staff, are desperate for a paycheck. Previously, I stopped forced medication upon complaint to the U. S. Prescription card service for Medicaid and Medicare that my signature was forged and then delivered by a court order without any indication of this manner, yet used as a method for control, that I would not capitulate, and I still refuse to medicate. I graduated from St. Mary's University with a Bachelor's that I was employed in my own company contracted to the Department of Defense writing government-grade encryption for ten years, and my boss was at the Pentagon in Washington. I finally lost this contract and I attribute this to Steel/McWhorter, that later I attempted to regain my contractor record and references, only to find that my small corporation had been hijacked. I have continuous phone problems, both landline and cell, and with Steel/McWhorter association AT&T. It is my understanding that state Commissioner of Health Services Chris Traylor is about mid-sixties and looking forward to retirement, like Steel/McWhorter, yet his photos are now of a man appearing to be late thirties, that Steel/McWhorter has accomplices. I urge you to read my complaints in Cause No. CR-14-0027 in the district court in the county of Hays, Texas, that this monster be stopped, respectfully. Novitas Solutions funds my incarceration, without my consent, that the average payment, per day, is about $660.00 as I understand, that overhead, might be $60, per day, and that the remaining amount is profit, privately, and for payment from The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, and this for all patients for this facility alone, that Novitas then charges the excess of about $340.00 per patient, per day, for bill servicing.

For example, one state alone has nearly 9,000 boots on the ground for this cause. Our own FDA labels the drugs in horses as unfit for food animals. Currently Bernie is a cosponsor of S.1214, the 114th Congress version of the Safeguard American Foods Export Act. Although 30 Senators and 189 members of the House cosponsor this bill, Bernie is the only Presidential contender to cosponsor it. The bill, although it should be bipartisan, is supported far more by Democrats than Republicans -- a fact that has not gone unnoticed by many Republican horse people who are shifting alliances . So the Republicans, myself included, can look forward to losing a Presidential election because their Congressmen FREQUENTLY underestimate the power of the people to rally around #foodsafety.

"1165819743448178_1167756403254512",0,"executive action regarding guns, focusing on increasing background checks. But there’s a little detail regarding the “mental competence” of a potential gun purchaser which should get everyone’s antennae twitching — because the government will be defining it.  Obama has already started working on disarming veterans. And don’t think you won’t be next.  Note: We originally published the remainder of this article in June of 2015. Clearly, this little plan has been in the works for some time.  As WND reported two years ago, the Obama administration had begun sending out what it insisted were routine letters informing veterans that an unidentified “report” indicated they may be declared incompetent and consequently stripped of their Second Amendment rights.  It’s not just veterans with PTSD or depression. The VA recommends many military veterans who it deems “incompetent” and in need of financial assistance to manage their benefits be placed in the “mental defective” category of the national gun ban list.  But it’s getting much, much worse. Are you ready for this?  WND reports people who live with veterans now are being ordered not to possess a gun, and some veterans are told they can “buy back” their Second Amendment rights by giving up their veterans’ benefits.  The United States Justice Foundation (SJF) has uncovered what it sees as a coordinated effort by multiple federal agencies to disarm the American people. The tactics being used are not just violating the Constitutional rights of Americans, but include outright criminal acts such as extortion and blackmail. Veterans continue to be the primary target, but the groundwork has been laid to expand the disarmament efforts to the rest of the population.  The veterans are clearly considered the most dangerous of the gun owners in the country because there are 23 million of us and we all took an oath of office to “protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” We are trained to do just that so we pose a threat to those who want to take away our Constitutional republic.  Some veterans get the letter from the VA telling them that because of physical or mental disabilities they are going to be declared incompetent to handle their own financial affairs, and the VA will appoint a fiduciary for them. The veterans are given 60 days to prove they are competent, which is a direct violation of the due process clause of the Constitution that requires the burden of proof be on the government.  The letter also tells the veteran that once they are declared incompetent they can no longer own, possess, purchase, or transport firearms or ammunition. If they do they will be prosecuted. The names of veterans who have been declared incompetent are sent by the VA to the FBI where they are automatically declared to have been adjudicated to be mentally defective to the point of being a danger to themselves or others. They are put on the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and can no longer legally purchase firearms.  Obama Stabs veterans in backHowever, none of the veterans who received the letter received any sort of hearing, nor have they been examined by a psychiatrist, psychologist or medical doctor. Even anyone simply LIVING with a veteran can be put on the banned list.  But here’s the wonderful little bit of extortion our government throws in. USJF says veterans who are declared incompetent are being told that if they want to have their Second Amendment rights restored they can simply sign a form from the VA giving up their VA benefits. This is simply unbelievable. On the one hand the VA and the FBI have found veterans to be mentally ill and too dangerous to be allowed to own firearms, while on the other hand allowing these allegedly dangerous people to buy their firearm rights back.  What’s more, in direct violation of the federal HIPAA law that was SUPPOSED to protect the privacy of our medical records, The Department of Health and Human Services is passing the the records of anyone who has ever told their physician they were feeling depressed over to the FBI, even if never treated, and anyone who has taken certain drugs for things like PTSD, ADD, or ADHD, among others. All of these people will eventually be added to the NICS list.  I’m getting depressed thinking about this – uh-oh, I guess I shouldn’t have said that out loud. You never know who’s listening in.  Maybe this is one way the government plans to keep Medicare and Social Security afloat. Want a gun? Sure, just hand over the benefits you spent your whole life earning.

Where Refugees get Governments Benefits for LIFE? Our Seniors are struggling with no raises while we are allowing immigrants benefits for life??? We are not talking just 10,000 refugees either, but rather 85,000 immigrants. Obama has brought millions of refugees into the country all receiving benefits for life, which include HUD (free housing), SSI, SS, food stamps, Medicare, Medicaid, tuition and only God knows what else. Does everyone see how we are $18 trillion in debt? And 90% of the refugees never stop collecting benefits. Trust me, Ryan will try and sneak this bill through while the taxpayers are busy preparing for Christmas hopefully so you will not notice. Again Mr Kelly, how are you going to VOTE? The real irony is we can have Syrians use taxpayer money to blow stuff up in America.     http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/01/jeff-sessions-rings-alarm-about-spending-bill-obama-will-be-allowed-to-bring-10000-syrians-into-america/",0

You can honor them by co-sponsoring the Zadroga Act to provide healthcare and compensation to 9/11 rescuers and survivors.   I'm an FDNY fireman that was forced to retire at 33 years old due to illnesses directly related to my exposure to the toxic dust at the WTC. Each year the illnesses pile up and leave me on most days unable to even go outside to play with my three small children. Please tell me why is it that you do not support the Zadroga act? As you may know most of us were not at work on 9/11 yet felt called to action to help the people of our city as well as our fellow firefighters. We lost 343 Firefighters that day and we have lost 130 to cancer directly attributed to that toxic dust in the days since.  These numbers are only going to go up in the future.  Unfortunately these illnesses are not limited to firemen. We have also lost 85 members of the NYPD to 9/11 cancer and there are thousands more still fighting it.  There are 33,000 rescue workers and over 70,000 people in total currently enrolled in the WTC health program covering almost every congressional district. This is not a NYC problem, this is an American problem.  What message are we sending the world when we leave so many people who sacrificed so much to hang out to dry.   We didn't hesitate to react when America was under attack, so why is congress so hesitant to provide us with the health care that we need to survive?   Our government let us down that day and in the days that followed.  That was proven when Republican Chrystie Whitman proclaimed the air at ground zero was safe to breathe.  Congress now has the chance to help us by providing the permanent healthcare that we deserve.       If my 343 brothers proved anything on 9/11/01 it's that we will keep climbing those stairs no matter what awaits us when we get there. I assure you that the steps of the capital pale in comparison to what I had to climb over at the World Trade Center.  I will continue to climb those steps to honor those that came before me and those yet to come because that is what my uniform means to me.

A  Public Religion Research Institute poll taken Feb. 4-8 found that only 18% of Americans believed immigrants should be deported while 78% agreed that immigrants should either be made citizens or permanent residents. That would appear to contradict your uncited reference. That same poll found that 52% of Americans agreed that  since Congress has not yet acted to address the immigration issue, President Obama's executive action on immigration was justified, compared to 42% who felt it was not.

When I saw this my world changed. The most beautiful dogs, pedigrees, stolen pets are butchered slowly but gradually by chopping their paws off , alive, putting a hook in their mouth to hang them and open their bodies or skinning them alive. Heads are chopped off, other way is that they blowtorch the bodies , then totally burned they are thrown in a pot of boiling water to be cooked alive. They don' t refrain from burning them alive. When you see and hear their screaming in front of other dogs who wait their turn you cannot look at that video anymore. What these animals need is animal rights law because this anno 2016 is not only atrocious but also dangerous. No medical control, everything done in the street, illnesses can easily develop there.

Graham begins his attack by accusing the democrats of protecting President Obama from having to veto the deal. He then goes on to discuss Iran, sharing recent threats by Iran against Israel. Can Democrats claim to love Israel at the same time that they feed us to the wolves in Iran? IRAN OPENLY DECLARES IT WILL VIOLATE it THE UNSC RESOLUTION REGARDING THE NUCLEAR DEAL AND WILL PROGRESS WITH IT’S WEAPONS BUILD-UP AND WITH ITS MISSILE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. –                                       WE DIDN’T MAKE THIS UP !!! THIS IS NOT PROPAGANDA, THIS IS FACT  !!! Iran’s three leaders – President Hassan Rouhani, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Deputy Foreign Minister and senior negotiator Abbas Araghchi – have open declared that Iran has no intention of abiding by UN Security Council resolution 2231, which endorses the nuclear deal and restrictions on Tehran’s missiles and weapons acquisition. Rather, they say they will abide only by the original nuclear deal. According to a report by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), Iran said that it separates the deal regarding its nuclear program from the UNSC resolution. Passed on July 25, the resolution endorses the deal and also includes prohibitions on Iran’s development of advanced ballistic missiles and its purchasing of other types of arms. IRAN WILL VIOLATE THE will  UNSC RESOLUTION LIKE IT DID  10 Years AGO. In a July 20 interview on Iranian Channel 2, Araghchi said that there had been tough bargaining between the Iranian and American delegations over the issue of the arms embargo on Iran and the sanctions related to Iran’s missile development project. He said that during the negotiations, the Americans demanded that the sanctions on Iran’s weapon build-up remain, because otherwise they would have a hard time selling the deal to the Arab countries. ”When they said that they could not lift the sanctions altogether, we told them explicitly that in that case there is no agreement. We told them that the national security issues are non-negotiable and that we will not accept an agreement which continues the embargo on weapons and the sanctions on missile development. In the end, the Americans said, We will put the issue of the embargo and the missiles in the UN Security Council Resolution separate from the agreement,” he said. In the same interview, Araghchi was asked whether Iran could refrain from carrying out UNSCR 2231. He replied: “Yes we can; just as we refrained from complying with UN Security Council resolutions, we can do so with regards to 2231.” Araghchi also referred to the Iranian Foreign Ministry statement issued following the passage of UNSCR 2231: “The Iranian Foreign Ministry statement explicitly noted that Iran does not attach legitimacy to any restriction and any threat. If UNSCR 2231 will be violated by Iran, it will be a violation of the Security Council resolution and not of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – the nuclear deal), similar to what happened 10 years ago when we violated Security Council resolutions and nothing happened. The text of the JCPOA notes the fact that the content of the JCPOA and of the UN Security Council resolution are two separate things.” ‘Violating UNSC Resolution Has No Consequences’ Foreign Minister Zarif, in an August 9 media interview, reiterated the Iranian position regarding the difference between the JCPOA and UNSCR 2231, with a focus on the consequences of possible violation of the two by Iran. “There is a difference between the JCPOA and UNSCR 2231. Violating the JCPOA has consequences, while violating UNSCR 2231 has no consequences,” he said Indeed, the restrictions regarding missiles are mentioned only in UNSCR 2231, and not in the JCPOA, MEMRI points out. ‘Iran Not Committed to the UNSC Resolution’ On August 29, 2015, Iranian President Hassan Rohani said “there is nothing about the topic of missiles, defense, and weapons in the JCPOA.  Whatever we have about it is in Resolution [UNSCR] 2231… Moreover, we have formally announced that we are not committed to all the sections that appear in the resolution [2231], and we specified in the JCPOA that violation of the resolution [2231] does not mean violation of the JCPOA.” The meaning of all this is that in everything related to the issue of missile development, Iran will disregard UNSCR 2231 and progress with its military development. Already during the negotiations, the Islamic Republic insisted that there be no imposition of sanctions on Iran’s missile development program. When the Americans moved the sanctions on the missile program to UNSCR 2231, IRAN DID NOT OBJECT, AS, ACCORDING TO THEIR STATEMENTS ABOVE, THEY CAN VIOLATE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS, AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST, AND THIS WILL NOT BE TECHNICALLY REGARDED AS A VIOLATION OF THE JCPOA.",0

This is what House Resolution 752 is all about, ending violence to dogs. It is not about the U.S. telling China what not to eat. Each year at Yulin Festival in China, dogs, mostly stolen pets, are sold where they endure the most extreme torture before being slaughtered. They are tortured because the Chinese believe that the meat with adrenaline in it will make them strong. The so called ""Festival"", that is man-made in 2009, tortures and kills over 10,000 dogs, mostly stolen pets! There are no animal rights in China. The government will not enforce the law to protect its citizens and their stolen pets. The citizens of China are crying for help. The United States and U.S. Congress are the leaders in human rights. Now, please take a stand and cosponsor H. RES. 752 and become a leader in animals rights for dogs. I will leave the video from the House Resolution 752 briefing on September 14, 2016 for you to view.

A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than “gotcha” moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people’s daily lives. A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking them to join in the great mission of building America. If we’re going to have arguments, let’s have arguments — but let’s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. … That’s a better politics. That’s how we start rebuilding trust. That’s how we move this country forward. That’s what the American people want. That’s what they deserve."" It seems you don't think the American people deserve this but you are so wrong.

If we want everyone to be covered by insurance, why are we punishing the agents?  Obamacare has put so many insurance companies out of business.

I know I will never get an answer because I have written other Rep n Congressmen n have not gotten anything!!!!!!   So I assume I will not be getting an answer from you or anyone else.

Lately I came in contact with shocking videos and posts in which cats and dogs in China are tortured to death in such a way that is far below the border of endurance. When I saw this my world changed. The most beautiful dogs, pedigrees, stolen pets are butchered slowly but gradually by chopping their paws off , alive, putting a hook in their mouth to hang them and open their bodies or skinning them alive. Heads are chopped off, other way is that they blowtorch the bodies , then totally burned they are thrown in a pot of boiling water to be cooked alive. They don' t refrain from burning them alive. When you see and hear their screaming in front of other dogs who wait their turn you cannot look at that video anymore. What these animals need is animal rights law because this anno 2016 is not only atrocious but also dangerous. No medical control, everything done in the street, illnesses can easily develop there. There is a report regarding this. When you cannot imagine that this is so bad please go to the facebook site of Marc Ching he has been there as a saviour and a witness. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. I am from Holland. Your country has always been our leading country in the world, honest, innovative and passionately involved.

The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2015 (S. 681 and H.R. 969) remains stalled in the respective Veterans Affairs Committees even though there is bipartisan combined support of 374 Senators and Congressmen who are sponsors/co-sponsors of this legislation. Passage of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2015 would restore health coverage for 90,000 Navy veterans who were potentially exposed to the toxic chemical Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Many from this group of war veterans have died from Agent Orange related diseases and many currently suffer from those same diseases and illnesses. With 331 Representatives and 43 Senators now supporting the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2015 (HR 969 and S 681), it should be apparent to VA Secretary McDonald that Congress is in favor of RESTORING the presumption of exposure to Agent Orange to the sailors who served in the territorial seas. That was the intent of Congress in 1991 with passage of the Agent Orange Act of 1991. In April 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) in Gray vs McDonald vacated the Board of Veterans Appeals decision on appeal ""as arbitrary and capricious because the decision was based on VA's flawed interpretation of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii)"". The CAVC remanded the matter for the VA ""to reevaluate its definition of inland waterways – particularly as it applies to Da Nang Harbor – and exercise its fair and considered judgment to define inland waterways in a manner consistent with the regulation's emphasis on the probability of exposure"". A January 12, 2016 bi-partisan letter addressed to VA Secretary Robert McDonald co-signed by 14 Senators had no apparent effect on VA policy which targets a specific group of Vietnam Veterans who honorably served their country during a time of war. The following paragraph was part of the Senators’ letter: “We respectfully request that you use your statutory authority to afford the presumption of service connection to veterans with Agent Orange-related diseases who served in the territorial seas of the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962 and May 7, 1975. We implore you to implement this change to the regulations immediately, so that the thousands of Blue Water Navy veterans can begin receiving the benefits that they have heretofore been unjustly denied.” [Emphasis added] The VA refused to resolve this issue under its own regulatory authority as requested. Instead, in a document released February 5, 2016, the VA doubled down by stating it would continue to limit benefits related to Agent Orange exposure to only those veterans who set foot in Vietnam, where the herbicide was sprayed, and to those who were on boats in inland rivers. On February 25, 2016, Congressmen Chris Gibson & David Valadao and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand & Steve Daines wrote a letter to VA Secretary McDonald and Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson which, in part read: ""We are greatly concerned that these Veterans have long been overlooked since the 2002 regulatory change, which excluded them from presumptive coverage for illnesses connected to Agent Orange exposure. This 2002 decision swung the pendulum too far, excluding tens of thousands of Veterans who were exposed while serving offshore through direct exposure and through their ships’ distillation processes. With significant medical and other research data, including evidence compiled by the Australians that has led to Australia’s recognition of Agent Orange exposure for these Veterans, over three quarters of the United States Congress (341 total Members of Congress, including 303 Representatives and 38 Senators) support H.R. 969 and S. 681, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act to correctly extend presumptive coverage for Agent Orange exposure to those who served in the Territorial Seas and bays and harbors of South Vietnam."" [Emphasis added] VA Secretary McDonald apparently has no intentions of restoring presumptive exposure benefits to Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans using his regulatory authority to do so. The VA policy of discrimination and deceit will continue if actions by the VA on February 5, 2016 go unchallenged by Congress and the citizens they represent. Politics & VA arrogance have forestalled efforts to right the ship for Vietnam Veterans exposed to toxic substances like Agent Orange while serving in an unpopular war.  These veterans were sprayed and betrayed by a nation who sent them into harm’s way. Government officials lied and VA benefits were denied to Veterans who have died from service-connected diseases and illness the VA acknowledges are attributed to exposure to toxic herbicides like Agent Orange. Vietnam Veterans still living, many suffering from the effects of agent orange exposure, will succumb to their service-connected maladies and pre-mature death. The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans served this nation honorably, but were disenfranchised by an ungrateful nation during their military service and for many years thereafter. Forty years later, they continue to be discriminated against by politicians and a broken VA bureaucratic system. How long must they suffer the consequences of their military service during a time of civil unrest and an unpopular brutal war in Southeast Asia? It's time to pass legislation to resolve the tactical herbicide exposure issue for all Vietnam Veterans, including US Navy and Marine veterans who served aboard ships that operated in a combat zone in waters offshore of the former Republic of Vietnam.",1

"816209285150547_844312832340192",0,"(Washington, D.C.) – Today, Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) named Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) its April Porker of the Month for being the only member of Congress shameless enough to brag about securing an earmark in CAGW’s 2016 Congressional Pig Book.  Sen. Schatz secured an earmark of $5.9 million for the East-West Center in his home state of Hawaii.  The center, which is intended to promote better relations with Pacific and Asian nations, was established in 1960 with no congressional hearings and over the State Department’s opposition.  For years, the State Department tried to eliminate the center by not requesting funding in its annual budget requests.  Former Senate Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) was responsible for providing earmarks for the East-West Center until he passed away in 2013.  Sen. Schatz not only followed his predecessor’s lead by stepping up to the plate and earmarking funds for the center, he also openly bragged about his “achievement.”  In a December 17, 2015, press release, Sen. Schatz claimed credit for securing funding at a level $5.9 million above the administration’s request.  He also bloviated about a previous $5.9 million earmark in a June 19, 2014 press release, calling the funding, “great news for Hawaii.”  The East-West Center is similar to the North-South Center, which stopped receiving federal funding in 2001. An April 3, 2009, Congressional Research Service report stated, “Congress has not funded the North-South Center since FY 2001, noting that it should be funded by the private sector.”  Following that logic, the East-West Center should be funded by the private sector as well.  It probably would be, except that the center has long been located in the state of a Senate appropriator.  Since FY 1997, the center has received 13 earmarks totaling $121.5 million.  The 2016 Congressional Pig Book exposed 123 earmarks in FY 2016, which cost taxpayers $5.1 billion.  Since CAGW issued the first Pig Book in 1991, Congress has approved 110,442 earmarks costing taxpayers $323.1 billion.   CAGW President Tom Schatz (no relation) said, “It takes a special kind of arrogance to be the only member of Congress to boast about frivolously spending the taxpayers’ hard-earned money.  The East-West Center should immediately stop receiving federal dollars, just as the North-South Center did in 2001.  The continued funding of the center is not ‘great news for Hawaii,’ as Sen. Schatz claimed.  It is simply another example of why earmarks should be permanently banned.”   For his abuse of the budget process, waste of taxpayer money, and braggadocio, CAGW names Sen. Brian Schatz its April Porker of the Month.  Citizens Against Government Waste is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in government.  Porker of the Month is a dubious honor given to lawmakers, government officials, and political candidates who have shown a blatant disregard for the interests of taxpayers.",1

God Bless America.   Our country is still facing a multitude of critical issues ... each one with the capacity to destroy what Americans cherish - our freedom. While we look outside of our country and blame the terrorists for making us live in fear and threatening our lives.... please take a moment to look inside our country at the violence we are perpetuating against ourselves.  This is why I hope you will join me in helping millions of American families who are living in fear and experience violence every day - at the hands of people who are supposed to love and protect them. I am proposing a countrywide movement to educate people about the increase in domestic violence in this country.   What the movement needs more than anything are brave men standing with women and children shouting, ""No one should be in control of another human being by beating, abusing, or murdering them. Domestic violence is the worst violence because it is against innocent people, mostly women and children, by batterers, mostly men. Join us in stopping this epidemic NOW!""  Domestic violence is not only a Republican problem; it is also a Democrat problem. This problem affects every demographic, rich, poor, educated and not, all colors, all races, all religions.   1 out of 4 women are victims and 1 out of 15 men are victims - and we know these statistics are wrong because DV is under reported. What this movement really needs are people, especially men, to stand up to the abusers and tell them it is wrong, wrong, wrong to abuse, batter, control, and murder other people.  Our government pays millions and millions of taxpayers’ dollars to house the victims and give them a secure, safe environment with expensive security systems and guards at secret locations. These victims are afraid to go out in public, go to work, shop and have to change their normal routine, while the perpetrator's life, once again, usually remains the same.  Is this justice? I think not!  Domestic violence is not a family issue. It is a government issue. It is OUR issue!  I am asking you to use your influence to stop this epidemic of major proportion in our country which is affecting millions of women and children every day. Isn't our country supposed to protect the innocent? Will you join this movement today?  I recently took the 40-hour training to become a domestic violence advocate and asked the following question of several of the instructors who did not have an answer:  Why does a person (usually a woman) and the child(ren) have to flee their home sometimes in the middle of the night while the perpetrator (usually a man) gets to stay comfortably in his home while the legal process grinds slowly?   Would you join my cause:  1. In trying to pass legislation which would require the perpetrator to be removed from the home and put into a shelter with a security anklet or GPS system tracking the person?  2. To contact a variety of security companies to offer DV victims a security system at home.  3. Push for harsher consequences if a perpetrator ignores an order of protection, such as putting the perpetrator's assets at risk, (confiscate his means of transportation, and/or take the money for the home's security system out of the perpetrator's paycheck, for example) 4. Make the public aware of what a DV victim and the children go through as far as fearing for their safety, losing a safe place, being threatened, beaten, abused, and sometimes murdered by ""someone who is supposed to love and protect them"" 5. Publicly humiliate a DV perpetrator by putting the perpetrator's name, picture, and location in the newspaper and on the TV news as a public service announcement, such as is done for other crimes, like burglaries, car theft, arsonists, pedophiles, sex offenders, etc.  Will you help me by contacting your constituents and asking for stronger domestic violence laws so the victims can receive real justice?  I will be posting ways to start a ""grassroots"" effort. Together our voices our powerful - do not let domestic violence victims stand in isolation anymore.

Is it now time for the US Congress (you) to help save the horse racing industry by banning all slaughter, and transport to slaughter, of American Horses.

Edward Snowden is a young man and his own governing officials are not supporting or taking care of their citizens,appropriately,under many a circumstance.   U.S. President Obama's Administration is unable to continue to make references of some serious concerns as ""phony"" scandals. First Lady Diane Patrick of the Commonwealth of MA is fully aware of all the fraud and corruption and the unlawful tapping in on innocent citizens phone lines. The retaliatory actions and practices of our own governing officials is shameful and children deserve to be represented and serviced by honest law abiding elected and tax paid governing officials.   You owe Edward Snowden's family some honest dialogue and facts. It will set us all ""free"" of so much fraud and corruption,Attorney Bruce Fein,etc.... Regards, Elizabeth A.

For instance, in recent years, some 60 percent of the bank's activities have benefited 10 giant U.S. corporations, with 40 percent benefiting one company alone: Boeing. On the foreign side, the cheap loans are extended to giant state-owned companies such as Mexico's petroleum company, Pemex, and the United Arab Emirates' airline, Emirates. When the Ex-Im financing isn't benefiting a state-owned firm, it is often flowing to very successful private firms with plenty of access to capital, such as the loan extended to the richest woman in Australia to finance her iron ore project at the expense of its U.S competitors.  These Ex-Im companies may enjoy the perks of cheap financing and artificially inflated profits, but it's not fair for the 98 percent of U.S. exports generated without special treatment from the federal government. That's especially outrageous when the program has taxpayers on the hook for $140 billion.  The Department of Energy's 1705 loan program falls squarely in that category. A few years ago, it received a lot of media and political attention when one of its recipients, a solar company named Solyndra, defaulted on its $538 million loan guarantee, leaving taxpayers with the tab.  The overlooked scandal of the 1705, however, is that—as with the Ex-Im Bank—most of its beneficiaries are green energy projects backed by gigantic companies with plenty of access to capital, such as Goldman Sachs and NRG Energy.  But cronyism goes beyond loan guarantees. A 2012 paper by budget analyst Tad DeHaven calculated that subsidies to businesses alone cost taxpayers almost $100 billion each year. The subsidies flow to air carriers, community developers, fisheries and wineries. There are also billions in subsidies to rich farmers, on top of such things as the bailout of the automobile industry, which ended up costing $9.26 billion.  Whatever form it takes, this cronyism is harmful and it does very little to create sustainable jobs in San Bernardino County!",0

I am a United Kingdom citizen writing to you regarding a matter of global importance, over which you, especially at present, have great influence.  I am writing to ask you to please watch the 60-second video below, and please co-sponsor House Resolution 752 - to end the global dog meat trade.  On September 14th I watched the live broadcast from Congressman Alcee Hastings's congressional meeting in Washington, and was incredibly disturbed by the video below, which was played to the audience.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_p71BjjCP8  I knew that dogs were tortured horrifically before their death, but seeing the reality of it leaves us in no doubt that this has to stop. Dogs are strung up and beaten about the face and body with metal pipes, they are blow-torched, have their legs cut off, are thrown into vats of boiling water, are nail-gunned to walls, have their eyes gouged out - all while still alive - in the misguided belief that the more an animal suffers prior to its death the tastier the meat will be. Diners also believe that because the dog suffers so badly, this withstanding of so much pain prior to death somehow makes the man who eats the dog meat more virile. Even if this were true, there is no excuse for such barbaric cruelty. Some dogs are kept alive for over 48 hours and tortured continually during this time - imagine the suffering they endure before finally being released into death. Many of these dogs are pets which have been stolen from family homes; all they have known is love, and then they are plunged into the worst kind of hell imaginable.  Yulin 'Festival' 2017, and the global dog meat trade, must be stopped in its tracks. Gratituous, prolonged, inhumane torture of sentient beings does not belong in a civilised world, and we as a caring society cannot allow it to continue.  The USA sets a shining example to the rest of the world for humanitarianism, conservationism and caring for the environment and its inhabitants – both human and non-human. Please help us continue to do this in an exemplary way by supporting House Resolution 752.  I am confident that you and your colleagues in the House of Representatives will see this movement grow, including the worldwide boycott of several countries that is now taking place.  Thank you for your compassionate and open-minded consideration to co-sponsor House Res 752. Millions of citizens who have pets and care about animals will be forever grateful to you for your support.  Yours sincerely,  Kim Jameson Cheshire, England, United Kingdom",0

It is up to you to make sure you are on top, the iranians, chinese and russians are NOT our friends and yet we have the chinese and russians trying to bargain with the senate and congress to go against their country.

Our national security has been sold out to the Iranians for cold hard cash. If blood is shed it is on the hands of these idiots.  Daniel Greenfield at FrontPage Mag reports:  Senator Markey has announced his support for the Iran deal that will let the terrorist regime inspect its own Parchin nuclear weapons research site, conduct uranium enrichment, build advanced centrifuges, buy ballistic missiles, fund terrorism and have a near zero breakout time to a nuclear bomb. Markey had topped the list of candidates supported by the Iran Lobby. And the Iranian American Political Action Committee (IAPAC) had maxed out its contributions to his campaign.  After more fake suspense, Al Franken, another IAPAC backed politician who also benefited from Iran Lobby money, came out for the nuke sellout. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the Iran Lobby’s third Dem senator, didn’t bother playing coy like her colleagues. She came out for the deal a while back even though she only got half the IAPAC cash that Franken and Markey received. As did Senator Gillibrand, who had benefited from IAPAC money back when she first ran for senator and whose position on the deal should have come as no surprise.  In the House, the Democratic recipients of IAPAC money came out for the deal. Mike Honda, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Iran Lobby backed the nuke sellout. As did Andre Carson, Gerry Connolly, Donna Edwards and Jackie Speier. The Iran Lobby was certainly getting its money’s worth.  Both of Obama’s secretaries of state were involved in Iran Lobby cash controversies, as was his vice president and his former secretary of defense. Obama was also the beneficiary of sizable donations from the Iran Lobby. Akbar Ghahary, the former co-founder of IAPAC, had donated and raised some $50,000 for Obama.  The Iran Lobby had even tried, and failed, to turn Arizona Republican Jeff Flake. Iran Lobby cash had made the White House count on him as the Republican who would flip, but Flake came out against the deal. The Iran Lobby invested a good deal of time and money into Schumer, but that effort also failed.  Democrats in favor of a deal that will let a terrorist regime go nuclear have taken money from lobbies for that regime. They have broken their oath by taking bribes from a regime whose leaders chant, “Death to America”. Their pretense of examining the deal is nothing more than a hollow charade.  This deal has come down from Iran Lobby influenced politicians like Kerry and is being waved through by members of Congress who have taken money from the Iran Lobby. That is treason plain and simple.",1

Suddenly the political situation in your country changes and a few months later soldiers are gathered in front of your house. And in front of your neighbours’ houses. They say that if you don’t fight for them, they will shoot you. Your neighbour refuses. One shot. That’s it.  You overhear one of the soldiers telling your wife to spread her legs. Somehow you get rid of the soldiers and spend the night deep in thought. Suddenly you hear an explosion. Your house no longer has a living room. You run outside and see that the whole street is destroyed. Nothing is left standing.  You take your family back into the house, and then you run to your parents' house. It is no longer there. Nor are your parents. You look around and find an arm with your Mother’s ring on its finger. You can’t find any other sign of your parents.  ~~~~~  ""But asylum seekers have so many luxury goods! Smartphones, and designer clothes!""  ~~~~~  You immediately forget it. You rush home, and tell your wife to get the children dressed. You grab a small bag, because anything bigger will be impossible to carry for a long time, and in it you pack essentials. Only 2 pieces of clothing each can fit in the bag. What do you take? You will probably never see your home country again. Not your family, not your neighbours, your workmates… But how can you stay in contact?  You hastily throw your smartphone and the charger in the bag. Along with the few clothes, some bread and your small daughters favourite teddy.  ~~~~~  ""They can easily afford to get away. They aren’t poor!""  ~~~~~  Because you could see the emergency coming, you have already scraped all your money together. You managed to save some money because of your well paid job. The kind people smuggler in the neighbourhood charges 5,000 euros per person.  You have 15,000 euros. With a bit of luck, you’ll all be able to go. If not, you will have to let your wife go. You love her and pray that you the smugglers will take you all. By now you are totally wiped out and have nothing else. Just your family and the bag. The journey to the border takes two weeks on foot.  You are hungry and for the last week have barely eaten. You are weak, as is your wife. But at least the children have enough. They have cried for the whole 2 weeks. Half the time you have to carry your younger daughter. She is only 21 months old. A further 2 weeks and you arrive at the sea.  In the middle of the night you’re loaded onto a ship with other refugees. You are lucky: your whole family can travel. The ship is so full that it threatens to capsize. You pray that you don’t drown. The people around you are crying and screaming. A few small children have died of thirst. The smugglers throw them overboard. Your wife sits, vacantly, in a corner. She hasn’t had anything to drink for 2 days. When the coast is in sight, you are loaded onto small boats. Your wife and the younger child are on one, you and your older child are on another.  You are warned to stay silent so that nobody knows you’re there. Your older daughter understands. But your younger one in the other boat doesn’t. She doesn’t stop crying. The other refugees are getting nervous. They demand that your wife keeps the child quiet. She doesn’t manage it. One of the men grabs your daughter, rips her away from your wife and throws her overboard. You jump in after her, but you can’t find her again. Never again. In 3 months she would have turned 2 years old. Isn’t that enough for you? They still have it too good here and have everything handed to them on a plate?  You don’t know how you, your wife and your older daughter manage to get to the country that takes you in. It’s as though everything is all foggy. Your wife hasn’t spoken a word since your daughter died.  Your older daughter hasn’t let go of her sister’s teddy and is totally apathetic. But you have to keep going. You are just about to arrive at the emergency accommodation. It is 10pm. A man whose language you don’t understand takes you to a hall with camp beds. There are 500 beds all very close together.  In the hall it’s stuffy and loud. You try to get your bearings. To understand what the people there want from you. But in reality you can barely stand up. You nearly wish that they had shot you. Instead you unpack your meagre possessions: Two items of clothing each and your smartphone. Then you spend your first night in a safe country. The next morning you’re given some clothes. Among the donated clothes are even branded ‘label’ clothes. And a toy for your daughter. You are given 140 euros. For the whole month.  ~~~~~  ""They’re safe here. Therefore they should be happy!""  ~~~~~  Outside in the yard, dressed in your new clothes, you hold your smartphone high in the air and hope to have some reception. You need to know if anyone from your city is still alive. Then a 'concerned citizen‘ comes by and abuses you. You don’t know why. You don’t understand “Go back to your own country!"" You understand some things like “smartphone” and “handed everything on a plate.” Somebody translates it for you.  ~~~~~  And now tell me how you feel and what you own? The answer to both parts of that is “Nothing.”",0

Many members of animal welfare organizations presented their evidence of the extreme cruelty & torture these trusting & defenseless animals are forced to endure until they eventually are killed. It was truly the most heart wrenching & sickening display of depraved human behavior towards animals I have ever seen… and I will never, ever forget it.  Please realize there is a human element in this as well. Children are being exposed to these atrocities & are witness to the prolonged torture & agony these animals endure. Also, diseases the sick & dying dogs carry... rabies, cholera, etc. people are exposed to & consume.  I will always be grateful to Congressman Hastings for having the courage to sponsor this much needed resolution and it is heartening to see my beloved state of California leading the way in support of it. Ms. Congresswoman, Pete Aguilar from the 31st Congressional District recently joined the other 14 California representatives in co-sponsoring this resolution & just last week Congressman Garamendi of the 3rd district informed me he will be supporting it as well.

Trade does not, however, exist in a vacuum, and for any agreement to be successful, we need to think bigger picture. Investing in our infrastructure, implementing comprehensive immigration reform, and reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank are some of the priorities that are being ignored during this debate. If we want to build an economy ready to compete with the rest of the world, we need to broaden this trade effort to include a commitment to actions that will bolster our economy back home.  “Accordingly, and after a great amount of input from constituents in the 10th District, I will vote no on trade promotion authority, known as fast track. I am open to trade legislation that enhances our ability to better compete in a global economy, but this approach is piecemeal and does not do enough to advance the interests and potential of the hard-working Americans I represent.

We do not have the right to do this to any animal, to any innocent living being...for heaven's sake, even the worst mass murderers are treated better than this....those who close their eyes and do nothing are complicit.  Dogs serve and protect us, think of the brave military dogs that go to war with our soldiers, the police dogs, the therapy dogs for our soldiers who suffer PTSD, guide dogs for the blind, companion dogs...their unconditional love and loyalty...is supporting House Resolution so much to ask??? Heaven forbid but perhaps one day you, or someone you love, may need the help of a dog to save your life!  Are we not supposed to fight for and defend those who cannot fight for and defend themselves? Every day, whilst you and I are working, eating, sleeping, enjoying our freedom and liberty and the comforts of life...these dogs and cats are being hung, beaten, their eyes gouged and dismembered all whilst alive and fully conscious, they are crucified and disemboweled, thrown into boiling water and as they struggle to escape they are pushed back, skinned alive, others will be restrained and sliced open, their heart and organs wrenched from their bodies as they take their final breath....others watch on from their cages in terror knowing they will be next...is this something you can ignore Sir?

How can one candidate be a person, who has NO US birth certificate but was born in Canada under Canadian jurisdiction, to a Cuban father and has a Canadian birth certificate, be a Natural Born Citizen? He is a naturalized-by-Congressional-statute citizen (Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952 sec.320).  And the other candidate be a person born in 1971 to two Cuban parents that didn't Naturalize until 1975. Because of his parents naturalization in 1975 he is a naturalized-by-Congressional-statute citizen (Naturalization Act of 1795 sec.3), not a natural born citizen.   One universal point all early publicists agreed on was natural-born citizen must mean one who is a citizen by no act of law. If a person owes their citizenship to some act of law (naturalization for example), they cannot be considered a natural-born citizen.   A naturalized citizen can never be a Natural born citizen. It has always been known that to be Natural born one needs to be born of TWO CITIZEN PARENTS on US soil unless in the military stationed over seas or a Government official living over seas.  It is literally IMPOSSIBLE for either to be Natural Born Citizens. Sounds like fraud or a usurpation of the Constitution and the Country to me.

Given that there have been many teens and women suicide Jihadis among the cells, as demonstrated in Paris and Israel (amongst other locations), isn't it sexist and discrimantory to state that women and children will comprise the majority of refugees allowed in?  And if that sort of discrimination is deemed justifiable, is it not at least equally justifiable to assert that Christians and Yazidis be provided preference, since it is they who have been uniformly and systematically persecuted from Jihadist factions on both sides of the Syrian conflict?           If this was strictly a ""partisan"" vote as opposed to one calculated to assure safety of our citizens, why did a significant number of House Democrats (about 50) joined Republican members in voting for this legislation?    To be sure, we want people from all over the world to be safe from attack, but why have the Syrian refugees gotten priority here, given the above.  Shouldn't we be doing things to stabilize region so that these refugees are able to remain in their homeland?  If, as President Obama states;  ISIS has been contained, why is there a humanitarian need to accept however many thousands of refugees from Syria?    Does the fact that there may be other means for visa-less entry into our country, which present a ""greater threat,"" justify compounding the risk by allowing in individuals from a region teaming Jihadist operatives?      And lastly, if it is truly a two year vetting process -- why is there opposition to putting on the breaks at this particular movement.   If these individuals face imminent harm, then how does the two-year process take them out of harms way.  In contrast, if it really is not a two-year process, then how are we safe from potential harm, assuming there is no means to vet these refugees, who have no reliable government sources for the vetting process.",1

"1066880416693290_1068178076563524",0,"HOW LONG WILL THIS INJUSTICE CONTINUE? The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2015 (S. 681 and H.R. 969) remains stalled in the respective Veterans Affairs Committees even though there is bipartisan combined support of 374 Senators and Congressmen who are sponsors/co-sponsors of this legislation. Passage of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2015 would restore health coverage for 90,000 Navy veterans who were potentially exposed to the toxic chemical Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Many from this group of war veterans have died from Agent Orange related diseases and many currently suffer from those same diseases and illnesses. With 331 Representatives and 43 Senators now supporting the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2015 (HR 969 and S 681), it should be apparent to VA Secretary McDonald that Congress is in favor of RESTORING the presumption of exposure to Agent Orange to the sailors who served in the territorial seas. That was the intent of Congress in 1991 with passage of the Agent Orange Act of 1991. In April 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) in Gray vs McDonald vacated the Board of Veterans Appeals decision on appeal ""as arbitrary and capricious because the decision was based on VA's flawed interpretation of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii)"". The CAVC remanded the matter for the VA ""to reevaluate its definition of inland waterways – particularly as it applies to Da Nang Harbor – and exercise its fair and considered judgment to define inland waterways in a manner consistent with the regulation's emphasis on the probability of exposure"". A January 12, 2016 bi-partisan letter addressed to VA Secretary Robert McDonald co-signed by 14 Senators had no apparent effect on VA policy which targets a specific group of Vietnam Veterans who honorably served their country during a time of war. The following paragraph was part of the Senators’ letter: “We respectfully request that you use your statutory authority to afford the presumption of service connection to veterans with Agent Orange-related diseases who served in the territorial seas of the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962 and May 7, 1975. We implore you to implement this change to the regulations immediately, so that the thousands of Blue Water Navy veterans can begin receiving the benefits that they have heretofore been unjustly denied.” [Emphasis added] The VA refused to resolve this issue under its own regulatory authority as requested. Instead, in a document released February 5, 2016, the VA doubled down by stating it would continue to limit benefits related to Agent Orange exposure to only those veterans who set foot in Vietnam, where the herbicide was sprayed, and to those who were on boats in inland rivers. On February 25, 2016, Congressmen Chris Gibson & David Valadao and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand & Steve Daines wrote a letter to VA Secretary McDonald and Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson which, in part read: ""We are greatly concerned that these Veterans have long been overlooked since the 2002 regulatory change, which excluded them from presumptive coverage for illnesses connected to Agent Orange exposure. This 2002 decision swung the pendulum too far, excluding tens of thousands of Veterans who were exposed while serving offshore through direct exposure and through their ships’ distillation processes. With significant medical and other research data, including evidence compiled by the Australians that has led to Australia’s recognition of Agent Orange exposure for these Veterans, over three quarters of the United States Congress (341 total Members of Congress, including 303 Representatives and 38 Senators) support H.R. 969 and S. 681, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act to correctly extend presumptive coverage for Agent Orange exposure to those who served in the Territorial Seas and bays and harbors of South Vietnam."" [Emphasis added] VA Secretary McDonald apparently has no intentions of restoring presumptive exposure benefits to Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans using his regulatory authority to do so. The VA policy of discrimination and deceit will continue if actions by the VA on February 5, 2016 go unchallenged by Congress and the citizens they represent. Politics & VA arrogance have forestalled efforts to right the ship for Vietnam Veterans exposed to toxic substances like Agent Orange while serving in an unpopular war.  These veterans were sprayed and betrayed by a nation who sent them into harm’s way. Government officials lied and VA benefits were denied to Veterans who have died from service-connected diseases and illness the VA acknowledges are attributed to exposure to toxic herbicides like Agent Orange. Vietnam Veterans still living, many suffering from the effects of agent orange exposure, will succumb to their service-connected maladies and pre-mature death. The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans served this nation honorably, but were disenfranchised by an ungrateful nation during their military service and for many years thereafter. Forty years later, they continue to be discriminated against by politicians and a broken VA bureaucratic system. How long must they suffer the consequences of their military service during a time of civil unrest and an unpopular brutal war in Southeast Asia? It's time to pass legislation to resolve the tactical herbicide exposure issue for all Vietnam Veterans, including US Navy and Marine veterans who served aboard ships that operated in a combat zone in waters offshore of the former Republic of Vietnam.",0

Ask yourselves: Will gun control in the U.S. really stop terrorism? Congressman, do something that will start to dismantle the Islamic worldwide movement of global Shariah law. Stop the Muslim Brotherhood from operating not only in their underling organizations nationwide (CAIR, ISNA), but within our very government. House bill H.R. 3892, to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization has passed the House Judiciary Committee. As stated in the bill, the MB’s founder taught that it is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated, and thus that the mission of Islam, as interpreted and executed by the Muslim Brotherhood, must be to impose [Islamic] law on nations and to extend its power to the entire planet. I am writing to ask that you co-sponsor this bill and give it the strength it will need to maneuver the legislative processes and become law. Outlawing the MB will be a huge setback to the return of 8th century barbaric Islamic conquering by force. PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL.",1

From:  Veterans of Enewetak Atoll, South Pacific, Clean-up Project, (1977-1980)  Re: H.R. 3870 /S 2791 – Atomic Veterans Healthcare Parity Act  Dear Honorable Congressman, Senator, and Mr. President,   During 1977 – 1980 thousand of U.S. Military Service members were stationed at this remote island location in the joint services project of remediation and clean-up of the Enewetak Atoll islands from the ravage and decimation of the Atomic Testing of the 1940s and 1950s and its effects on the Peoples of the Marshall Islands.  The service members served with honor under the hot sun of the tropics, in minimal safety gear, tee-shirts, and even bare chested worked 12-hours daily scraping, drilling, removing contaminated soil and debris and encasing the debris under a large concrete dome, in a long forgotten crater from a previous bomb test which vaporized the area.  We were all told its safe, and there would be no risk of service, and that the occupational levels of risk were minimal.  Fast forward 40 years, out of the 352 known survivors of the Enewetak Atoll, at a minimum of 35% are suffering from life threating illness, health challenges, and facing an uncertain future, and facing death.  Today, many are facing increased medical issues, large hospital bills, and unpaid expenses and varying degree of frustration with the Veterans Administration with unequal treatment, failed reviews, and regulations which hinder the veterans access to medical and programs of recovery.  Many veterans are facing lung cancer, bone cancer, skin cancer, obstructive pulmonary disease, tumors, cysts and other deliberating illness which prevent them from working, unable to provide for their family, unable to receive necessary and entitled benefits from the VA due to a miss-guided review of regulations as to being occupational exposed to ion radiation, rather than a presumptive condition due to being an Atomic Veteran, and are facing this long nightmare and tragic medical issues for honorable and humanitarian service at Enewetak Atoll.  Congress is considering two bills H.R. 3870 in the House, and S2791 in the Senate to classify these service members as Atomic Veterans, and level the playing field for this injustice.  We are reaching out to you as a group to support these laws, and Co-Sponsor the legislation and press the respective congressional committees to take positive action and move the proposed bills to the full House and Full Senate for approval and send to the President to amend the law and protect the veterans of Enewetak Atoll, they have no other way of justice, medical care, and a piece of mind for the limited future they may have.  In addition, the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars have endorsed the bill and are helping us drive it forward. Excellent progress has been made so far (especially in this Congress!) but we need to keep pushing, we are currently trying to gather 100 cosponsors of the bill as that will garner special attention to the bill and will help us to pass it. We are currently at 33 so we have some ways to go but I know that we will get there, as well as the recently sponsored senate bill co-sponsored by Senator Franken and Senator Tillis.  Please stand with us, make medical care and other program available to the veterans who served with honor and gave their all in service at Enewetak Atoll.  Thank you for your support, and voting to stand with the veterans of the joint services of the US Army, US Navy, US Air Force, US Coast Guard.  Thank you.

As you know, House Resolution 752 condemns the dog meat trade and affirms the commitment of the United States to the protection of animals in Asian countries and around the world. The dog and cat meat trade is real. The slaughter is happening daily. What these dogs experience isn't torture, it is beyond the definition of torture. I don't know about you but I am an animal lover, and I am traumatized by the images and videos I see on social media of dogs being boiled alive, blow-torched alive, hung from meat hooks and skinned alive; their paws are cut off and they are dismembered while they are still alive and in full view of other dogs awaiting the same horrific fate. There is no place in modern society for these barbarically cruel practices. Please cosponsor  House Resolution 752.

Hastings, to oppose the Yulin dog-eating “Festival"" (June 21), the dog and cat meat trade in Asia and, mostly, the horrific cruelty involved. Please keep in mind, this Resolution is NOT about differing cultural practices (i.e., eating dogs vs eating cows), but instead about the deliberate torturing of dogs and cats for completely unfounded beliefs such that the surge of adrenaline produced in the animal while being tortured, makes the meat tastier and has medicinal benefits.  These animals, many of which are stolen pets, are crammed into the smallest cages for transport, not fed or hydrated and then intentionally tortured. These animals are dismembered, boiled, electrocuted, crucified and skinned all while still conscious before they are basically allowed to die. All of this purposeful torture occurs because of the belief that the more pain these animals endure, the tastier the meat and the more virility it provides to those who consume them. Please, I beg of you to end the heinous torturing practices by co-sponsoring H. Res 752.   For more information on the dog meat trade in Asia in general, please take a look at the website and Facebook page of  Marc Ching, who is currently risking his life to fight against the Yulin Festival and the dog meat trade in person. His Facebook page is: www.facebook.com/animalhopeandwellness/ and his foundation’s website is www.animalhopeandwellness.org/    Thank you for taking the time to read this email and the information provided.

"965102753577117_965491433538249",0,"I respectfully disagree with you, Rep. Lowenthal. I know there are still 5 million people who cannot get insurance through ObamaCare. They do not qualify because Medicare requirements have not been expanded in many of the states. I know of people who are below the federal poverty line, they have serious medical problems that could paralyze them, land them in the hospital with life-threatening complications, and they still cannot get insurance. Some have struggled to find jobs because they have health problems that they need care for and employers do not want to hire employees who they can see their physical health problems. How is ObamaCare helping those who do not qualify for it, who cannot get insurance through a job, and do not have any way to pay for doctor visits except out-of-pocket? I know a number of people who are later 30s and 40s who have serious health complications and the only way a younger person can qualify for insurance is they must have a job. If they have serious health problems that keep them from being competitive in the workplace (due to life-threatening complications and health issues) and the only way to get insurance (if you cannot get it through a job and cannot pay for it out-of-pocket) is to apply for disability. Those who are younger and have serious problems and need disability cannot even get it sometimes, because they have no insurance and cannot pay for tests, such as the much-needed MRIs, which can cost $2,000 for a single MRI. There are few clinics willing to take those who cannot verify their income either, because they do not have a traditional job. Thus, clinics with ""sliding scales"" cause problems for people who may work non-traditional jobs, due to health problems, etc. I can say personally I was charged $276 a visit from a clinic that offered care for low-come patients because I could not verify my income with a physical paystub, despite having electronic records of my annual earnings through tax records. There are few clinics that are willing to take a patient for a $5 donation for their care. For the 22 million people who have health insurance that would not otherwise have health insurance, ObamaCare has been great. However, I think until the poorest of Americans with health problems have a health care option, I think ObamaCare has let them down. There should be more options than those who really need the insurance to apply for disability or be forced to work a job that they may not be able to do because of health issues. They should not have to feel applying for disability is their only option because they simply need care and cannot get it because they cannot afford insurance. They should not have to feel no one cares about their health or feel hopelessness because they feel there are no options left, but to apply for disability and wait to get denied because they cannot prove they need disability because they cannot get insurance.",0

The Immigration and Nationality Act passed June 27, 1952 revised the laws relating to immigration, naturalization, and nationality for the United States. That act, which became Public Law 414, established both the law and the intent of Congress regarding the immigration of Aliens to the US and remains in effect today. Among the many issues it covers, one in particular, found in Chapter 2 Section 212, is the prohibition of entry to the US if the Alien belongs to an organization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by ""force, violence, or other unconstitutional means."" This, by its very definition, rules out Islamic immigration to the United States, but this law is being ignored by the White House.Islamic immigration to the US would be prohibited under this law because the Koran, Sharia Law and the Hadith all require complete submission to Islam, which is antithetical to the US government, the Constitution, and to the Republic. All Muslims who attest that the Koran is their life's guiding principal subscribe to submission to Islam and its form of government.

In the coming days, MOAA will testify on the MCRMC recommendations to revamp retired pay, health care, and more.  The MCRMC’s proposal includes eliminating TRICARE for military families and working-age retirees and replacing it with a health plan similar to what federal employees use, while overhauling retirement benefits.  Meanwhile, the administration’s FY 2016 budget rehashes many proposals that don’t attempt to modernize or reform pay and benefits—they simply continue to erode them. There are recommendations to:  cap your military pay for the third straight year. The proposed raise is deceptive because it is far below private-sector increases. Paychecks may look bigger, but your spending power is actually going down; continue the erosion of the $1 billion commissary subsidy. Proposed cuts would lead to an eventual 66 percent decrease in your purchasing power; increase out-of-pocket housing expenses by 5 percent; and consolidate TRICARE's Prime, Standard, and Extra programs into one plan. Working-age retirees will absorb the Prime enrollment fee, pay Standard copayments and deductibles and, for the first time ever, pay for service in military treatment facilities. If these proposals are included in next year’s defense bill, the annual loss of purchasing power for an O-3 family of four would be over $6,400.

They have rent control there but it boomerangs on older folks because no property owner wants to rent to an older tenant because of their ""Protected Status"". And any building owner knows if his property isn't generating market rate rents, then it won't fetch as much when he puts it up for sale. Market rates are notched into supply and demand.

Through funding and grants to all they wished and making sure none could ever be competition. The bavarian police arrested and hung all they could capture in 1786 when the house of rothschild planned the banking destruction of bavaria, through selling down. A process only the one with thousands of times more assetts than any others can engage in, a truly fixed system called the stock exchange.

I am saddened as we all are by all these tragedies but we law-abiding citizens are not responsible for them, we are not the criminal or mentally deranged or terrorists and these new la infringements only punish peaceful civilians, treating us like Common criminals. And by the way they do infringe on our 2nd Amendment rights in many ways including adding fees and taxes creating a royalty class. Then, after all this, the criminals will still get their guns illegally, unregistered, using any size magazines they want. All this can only be described as discrimination and violates the right of equal protection under the law for the rest of us. More regulation and laws are not the answer; it's just using what is a basic moral or mental brake down of a few to push an agenda. There are a great number of laws already against criminal activity, murder, drugs, and illegal guns, not one of these laws has stopped a person from stealing, murdering, dealing drugs, or obtaining illegal guns, if they are of the mindset to do so. And of course you and I both know that no specific type of gun or magazine commits a crime.  Plus there is already a Federal background check system in place. Next, laws are only enforceable AFTER they are disobeyed. There are laws against murder, and that still seems to happening. All the laws in the world have not, and will not stop one crime. But infringements erode the rights of We The People. The fewer rights and freedoms an honest man has, the more power the unlawful person, and gang or tyrant has over him. Giving Criminals, Tyrants and Gangs free rain. (i.e. NY, IL, CA and now MD) If a government Representative really believes that guns don't increase their safety...they should start first by not using armed guards or escorts, and not carrying concealed weapons, other wise they are being hypocritical. And I don’t want to hear that they are in greater danger then us. That is just like saying they have a right to live and rest of us do not! Can they guarantee the rest of us their will be no more crime or murder. No you cannot, now or any time in the future!  Add to all this is the fact that those Extremists who are pushing for the most and worst gun bans have proven they know nothing about the things they want to ban much less the Constitution they have taken an oath to defend. 	Many of our elected representatives suffer from; Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a personality disorder in which the individual being excessively preoccupied with issues of personal adequacy, power, prestige, and vanity. First formulated in 1968, it was historically called megalomania and is severe egocentrism.  	The right of choice is the bedrock of freedom up to the point where a choice made is criminal or immoral, and denies others their freedoms or rights: The right and choice of free speech or not, the right and choice of religious choice or not, the right and choice to be armed or not, etc. But those that do not wish to have or use these freedoms have no right to keep others from doing so. This is inclusive of our elected. 	In fact if anything we should be working to repeal all existing laws. Regulations and polices that presently infringe upon rights and freedoms under the Constitution in this Republic. Neither federal, state, local laws nor a majority can overwrite the U S Constitution. Enforcement of Infringements is Illegal.   	Why should our brave men and woman sacrifice for FREEDOM while it is being removed? We are presently under attack as a nation and need our 2nd Amendment as much now as ever. 	Thank You    MSgt Retired, M. E. Wieczynski",1

Because of you and your completely out-of-touch cohorts (a/k/a the Republican   Majority Congress), young adults (18-26) have just been stripped of their health insurance coverage. These young adults will no longer be able to remain covered under their parents' heath insurance plans until age 26, and therefore, will either have to (i) obtain individual insurance and pay extremely high premiums, which NO full-time student can afford, or (ii) go without health insurance.    Tennessee is not a wealthy state. 90% of UTK students come from low to middle class families. Therefore, sadly, the majority of UTK students (my son included) will have no option other than to go without health insurance.  Female students will either go without birth control (and women's health exams), or pay 100% of the costs thereof.    Btw, birth control pills are hormones (progestin and estrogen); 65% of birth control pills are prescribed for purposes that have nothing to do with contraception. They are used to treat a vast array of medical conditions, inching, but not limited to, ovarian cysts, endometriosis, infirtility, irregular periods, excessive menstrual bleeding, pre-and post-menopausal symptoms and even mental disorders.  This medication costs on average $150.00 per month ($1,600 annually); more than twice what it costs to feed a UTK student for an entire semester. Thus, female students will have to choose between food and medicine. .   I would like to know whose best interests you had in mind when you actively supported and pushed to repeal the Affordable Care Act because it most certainly was not your constituents.

This opportunity to seek such freedoms and hope has been rejected. Instead of choosing to be a productive member of there societies and live a wholesome life and respect there new neighbors. They have chosen instead a life of fear, misery, and pain. Rape, murder violence and suffering has been inflicted onto our friends by these guests. And there governments who are suppose to protect them have failed to do so. These refugees chose not to assimilate while holding there values dear and true to there hearts. Instead there ideals are violently projected against said people for whom they feel have no right to live peacefully amongst themselves and there way of life. Instead of treating there hosts with dignity, humility, and gratitude. They have chosen death sorrow and destruction. This ""president"" has instead ignored the facts and realities that our values and security are being threatened. and are under attack by reckless hate. We must not allow for this to happen in our nation and to its peoples. And it must be stopped before it is to late. We must put our petty differences to the side and unite as a peoples. We must watch over our neighbors, friends and families for our safety and way of life are under assault. This ""president"" has turned his back on us and will make us look like criminals and racists if the time is needed to defend ourselves against those who hold little to no value for peace and prosperity. When all we want is peace. Let us handle ourselves with dignity and courage. And give all of our efforts to a sound and peaceful resolution. If we do not let our voice be herd to all who will listen. Whether it be man woman or child. Rich or poor Great harm will come to us all. Let our government know we do not want these refugees here in our great nation. Nor do we wish them harm to those who respect us and our way of life. It is that I feel our nations greatest threat. Not from our enemies. But from our own elected leaders who have chosen to ignore the voice of the people",0

Matsui  House of Representatives                                                                      Honorable Matsui:   We families are counting on you to vote yes to vote HR Bill 2646 Helping Families in a Mental Health Crisis Act with all 5 provisions that are so important to have the best possible bill to FIX America's Broken Mental Health System. House of Representative Bill 2646 passed out of the Full Committee 53 HYea’s and 0 yes that is zero Nay’s.  I will be coming before the full House of Representatives we believe at some point in July.  We are counting on your vote to pass HR Bill 2646 with all 5 provisions out of the House of Representatives with a majority vote. If this happens it will be the most historical legislation ever passed in the best interest of those with serious and persistent mental illness in over 50 years. It is my sincere hope that this can be accomplished. As a parent who had a son develop a serious and persistent mental illness paranoid schizophrenia at the age of 18 in 1984. I can assure you this is the best legislation to fix America's Broken Mental Health System. The 5 provisions are essential to addressing the needs of people with mental illness. (1) IMD - Psychiatric beds were important every time my son was psychotic state those first 13 years.  Fortunately, with persistence we were always able to get him in treatment when needed. (2) AOT - Assisted Out-Patient Treatment was also extremely important and when my son was released the last time I requested an AOT order. We received the court order for my son and I let him know if he did not stay on medication he would go back to state hospital. (3) HIPPA (Privacy Law) also was very important. My son's psychiatrist at a Fountain House Model program in our state called me and said if my son did not try new medications he would never be better. That was when I told her about a medication he had been on that we saw very positive signs until the psychiatrist at state hospital added another medication. Our son would not have been able to tell her about this medication. She said she would give it another try and 4 weeks later he was not hearing voices for the first time in 5 years. (The voices had been so strong you had to tap him on his shoulder to get his attention to listen to you when you spoke). He went from a half-way house to an apartment of his own. He was in remission/recovery for the next 11 years never returning to state hospital. In September 2008 he could no longer take that medication due to a blood condition that sometimes happens with that medication that gave him this wonderful quality of life because of a condition that could be fatal. In between medications he somehow got MRSA the super but for which there are no antibiotics to kill infection and he passed away on 11/11/08 at age 43. Forever, thankful for his life and the 11 years of remission/recovery. We almost got him totally back in those 11 years. (4) SAMHS- Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration - Needs Reforming with an Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders - who must be a Doctor - Psychiatrist/Psychologist to coordinate all efforts in programs, grants in the importance of mental health and severe mental illness with evidence based practices. (5) PAMH- Protection and Advocacy and Mental Illness - Fight for the Right to humane and loving treatment delivered by mental health professionals. Peer Supports must be trained, monitored and under the authority of the patient’s psychiatrists.  All of the above is important to promoting the opportunity for the patient to reach remission/recovery for those with serious and persistent mental illness. Parent/Family Member/Main Caregiver should be a part of the treatment team for no one knows the patient better and can sometimes see things the professional may miss simply because they did not know the person before coming ill. I pray you will vote for this important legislation. We must stop ignoring these helpless human beings in America. America can do this and get it right with the science and technology we have today. VOTE FOR HR BILL 2646 HELPING FAMILIES IN A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ACT WITH ALL 5 PROVISIONS! WE ARE COUNTING ON YOU! MY SON WAS BREATHING, LIVING, WALKING PROOF THAT TREATMENT WORKS IF YOU CAN GET IT!

Congresspeople who support horse slaughter (by not ending it) are allowing extreme cruelty to 150,000 American horses.    Fact: 80% of Americans oppose horse slaughter.  Fact: The American Pet Food Industry voluntarily banned horse meat in 1978 as a reaction to American consumers' abhorrence of slaughtering horses.  Fact: The link between crime and horse slaughter has been proven. Common crimes include horse theft, animal cruelty, racketeering, false documentation hiding toxins, transport violations, and more.  Fact: USDA documented frequent, horrific injuries to horses in transport to slaughter in the USA including legs torn off, eyes hanging out of sockets, mares trampled while giving birth on trailers, and more.  Fact: USDA documented frequent failure of captive bolts to kill horses, resulting in disembowelment and legs sawed-off of fully conscious horses.  Fact: 92% of horses slaughtered are young and healthy. Slaughter is not a way to ""dispose of old, sick or injured"" horses.  Fact: Cattle/Beef/Meat lobbyists are preventing a ban on horse slaughter in (unfounded) fear of a ""slippery slide"" to banning cattle slaughter. Fact:  Graphic horse slaughter videos are outraging Americans and many are choosing to give up red meat because of horse slaughter.   Fact: AQHA lobbyists are preventing a ban on horse slaughter because they like an easy way to cull overbred Quarter Horses, whose foal numbers feed their registration-fee income base. Fact: 70% of horses going to slaughter are Quarter Horses, often mares with a foal by their side and bred back. Foals 6 months and older are slaughtered, too.  Fact: You can support local economies by taking money out of kill-buyers' hands, and placing it into the hands of your region's local veterinarians, rendering companies, backhoe operators and truckers, adding at least $1.5 million to the economy of each State.  Fact: American voters will keep fighting to end horse-slaughter. The fight to end horrific cruelty for 1% of American horses will continue, and escalate, until the loophole is closed and all slaughter of American horses is banned.  Fact: Your best interest is to listen to voters, not Cattle lobbyists and AQHA lobbyists. Lobbyists give you money, voters keep you in office.  Make the moral choice by cosponsoring and passing the SAFE ACT S1214 and HR1942. Thank you.",1
