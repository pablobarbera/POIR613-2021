Answering questions at a political campaign appearance, Mr. Reagan said that in the past several weeks the Federal Reserve had been working well.

For the last few years, the joke has been on those -- including me -- who were skeptical about the economic payoff to information processing. Now, alas, it is the optimists who look foolish.

"Columnists for this paper are not allowed to endorse politicians, but I'm going to break that rule just once and come out and say it: I'm a Trent Lott man. Really. I'm for Mr. Lott because he appears intent on holding to the extreme Republican position -- that we pass an across-the-board tax cut that gives away virtually the entire projected budget surplus, and that there be no compromise with the more realistic Clinton proposal. I'm for Mr. Lott because his extremism guarantees a Clinton veto of the whole tax bill, and, given the idiotic debate on this issue, that is the best outcome we could have right now. Because with no new tax bill, just gridlock, nothing changes. Gridlock when you're running a deficit is terrible. But gridlock when you're running a surplus is a blessing. It means the surplus just keeps piling up and goes to paying down the national debt. That reduces government borrowing and lowers interest rates, which means lower mortgage, student loan and credit card payments for everyone -- the best tax cut of all.",1999-08-03 00:00:00,"4fd20f3e8eb7c8105d781bc4","http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/03/opinion/foreign-affairs-the-dumb-old-party.html"

Let's look at both. It was not surprising to hear liberals extolling the legal creativity and courage of Chief Justice Roberts in finding a way to greenlight Obama's Affordable Care Act. But there is something deeper reflected in that praise, and it even touched some conservatives. It's the feeling that it has been so long since a national leader ''surprised'' us.

And Michael Novak, main author of a rival letter from a generally conservative group of lay Catholics, said the delay should not be read as indicating the bishops were backing down.",1985-04-04 00:00:00,"4fd159368eb7c8105d63dad2","http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/04/us/catholic-bishops-postponing-final-letter-on-the-economy.html"

"All of a sudden, the light at the end of the economic tunnel doesn't seem to be getting any closer. For much of this year, analysts expected the Federal Reserve Board's half-dozen cuts in interest rates to shift the economy out of neutral by the fourth quarter. Now, as autumn nears, medium- and long-term interest rates remain prohibitively high, and each day brings news of more layoffs. Pundits seize upon any sign of a turnaround, such as last month's growth in new home construction. Clearly, however, companies are finding few reasons to increase their investments. One obvious problem is that the Fed and the Bush administration are working at cross purposes. The Fed has been steadily lowering the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend reserves to each other on a day-to-day basis -- with the hope that other lending rates will follow suit. Since January, short-term rates have fallen by almost three percentage points. A drop in inflation, driven mainly by lower energy costs, has given the Fed room to make another cut at its meeting today.

"President Bush kicked off his general election campaign on Monday night, shedding his above-the-fray posture to deliver a robust defense of his record and begin an assault on the Democratic front-runner, Senator John Kerry. Facing declining poll numbers and concerted Democratic criticism, and urged by many Republicans to accelerate his timetable for partisan engagement, Mr. Bush used a speech here to assert that the election would present a clear choice between his steady leadership and Democrats who could not be relied on to make the tough decisions necessary to deal with the economy and the threat from terrorism. ''It's a choice between keeping the tax relief that is moving the economy forward, or putting the burden of higher taxes back on the American people,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It's a choice between an America that leads the world with strength and confidence, or an America that is uncertain in the face of danger.'' Without using Mr. Kerry's name, the president mocked him as a politician whose positions changed with the wind. The Democratic field, Mr. Bush said, is ''for tax cuts and against them. For Nafta and against Nafta. For the Patriot Act and against the Patriot Act. In favor of liberating Iraq and opposed to it. And that's just one senator from Massachusetts.'' The speech, delivered at a fund-raiser to benefit the Republican Governors Association, was billed by Mr. Bush's campaign as the start of a more aggressive phase of the race after months in which the president, to the growing consternation of some in his party, had remained largely on the sidelines. Much of the speech was forward-looking. It sought to position Mr. Bush as optimistic and steady in the face of serious challenges to the country and relentless attacks by Democrats who, he said, have failed to say how they would deal with the challenges the United States faces at home and abroad. ''Our opponents have not offered much in the way of strategies to win the war, or policies to expand our economy,'' he said, sounding a theme similar to one his aides tried out when it appeared that Howard Dean would be the Democratic nominee. ''So far, all we hear is a lot of old bitterness and partisan anger. Anger is not an agenda for the future of America.'' But his message that his party was taking the high road was undercut by a member of his cabinet, Rod Paige, the education secretary. In remarks to the nation's governors at the White House earlier in the day, Mr. Paige called the National Education Association, a longtime ally of the Democrats, a ''terrorist organization'' for resisting provisions of the education bill Mr. Bush signed into law in 2002. Mr. Bush, who has told Republican officials in recent weeks that he was eager to begin defending himself, was himself biting at times in his portrayal of his opponents. Alluding to Democrats who have criticized the war but agreed that the world is better of with Saddam Hussein out of power, Mr. Bush said, ''Maybe they were hoping he'd lose the next Iraqi election.'' In an indirect slap at Mr. Kerry, who in a 1970 interview suggested that the United States military should be deployed only under the auspices of the United Nations, Mr. Bush said he would never ''outsource'' national security to other governments. Mr. Kerry has since said his views have changed. Mr. Bush's political advisers said the speech was likely to be as close as the president comes to formally declaring his candidacy. Mr. Bush decided to go ahead with it, they said, after getting bad reviews from even some of his own supporters in two recent high-profile appearances: his one-hour interview this month on the NBC program ''Meet the Press'' and his State of the Union address last month. Even before Mr. Bush delivered his speech, Mr. Kerry tried to pre-empt him. In an appearance in New York, the Massachusetts Democrat said he had Mr. Bush ''on the run'' even before Democrats settled for certain on their nominee. He said the president had failed on the economy, had pursued a ''reckless'' foreign policy and was practicing ''crony capitalism and crony government.'' In a statement issued after Mr. Bush's speech, Mr. Kerry said: ''George Bush's credibility is running out with the American people. They want change in America and I'm running because I am determined to bring that change and put America back on track.'' While, Mr. Bush never mentioned Mr. Kerry by name, his campaign openly said it was now focused on him as its probable opponent and spent much of the day trying to exploit his long record of votes in the Senate to paint him as weak on national security. In focusing exclusively on Mr. Kerry as an opponent, Mr. Bush's aides risk making a mistake should Mr. Kerry falter and the Democrats nominate Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. In a statement, Mr. Edwards said the election was ''not about John Kerry's past or the president's past.'' He said, ''This election is about the future, and the new ideas we have that will change American so that it works for all of us.'' Mr. Bush invoked the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks several times in casting the election as a big choice for the American people. He sought to dispel rumors that he might drop Vice President Dick Cheney from the ticket, joking that he had again put Mr. Cheney in charge of his vice-presidential search and that Mr. Cheney had come up with the same recommendation he made in 2000. The speech got rousing applause at several points from the audience of Republican donors and governors, including the president's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, and the newest Republican star, Arnold Schwarzenegger of California. Mr. Bush has gradually become more involved in the day-to-day decision making in his campaign. The campaign's advertising team went to the White House two weeks ago to film him for appearances in television commercials. One senior White House official said Mr. Bush had been having a ''rolling conversation'' with his political strategists in recent weeks about how to proceed as Dr. Dean's candidacy collapsed and Mr. Kerry emerged as the front-runner. Mr. Bush's media team has moved forward with plans to purchase advertising time, asking stations about rates in 17 swing states, the vast majority of which were decided by five percentage points of the vote or less in 2000. Among them were Florida, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. Campaign officials have said that Mr. Bush's first advertisement will focus on his accomplishments, and that it would not attack Mr. Kerry.",2004-02-24 00:00:00,"4fd27afb8eb7c8105d83fa78","http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/24/us/the-2004-campaign-the-president-campaign-begins-as-bush-attacks-kerry-in-speech.html"

Herman Starobin, the union's director of research, told a meeting of the union's general executive board that preliminary data for May showed that at least 17 percent of the industry's experienced workers were still without jobs.",1982-06-25 00:00:00,"4fd1374b8eb7c8105d60990f","http://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/25/business/garment-field-jobless-at-18.1.html"

Here is a representative sampling of their thoughts on 1981: Edward Heberger, vice president of the Northeast Region of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers and an appraiser in Cheshire: Expect urban values to increase most significantly as interest in city living continues to grow. But be aware that not all neighborhoods are going to escalate at the same rate. Condominium prices may increase less dramatically than in the past because their relative value has now caught up with and, in some cases, even surpassed that of comparable single-family homes. Waterfront property will continue to command premium prices because of the limited supply.",1981-01-04 00:00:00,"4fd117798eb7c8105d5ce7fe","http://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/04/nyregion/connecticut-housing-experts-see-problems-worsening.html"
"Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve released the minutes of the most recent meeting of its open market committee -- the group that sets interest rates. Most press reports focused either on the Fed's downgrade of the near-term outlook or on its adoption of a long-run 2 percent inflation target. But my eye was caught by the following chilling passage (yes, things are so bad that the summarized musings of central bankers can keep you up at night): ''All participants anticipated that unemployment would remain substantially above its longer-run sustainable rate at the end of 2011, even absent further economic shocks; a few indicated that more than five to six years would be needed for the economy to converge to a longer-run path characterized by sustainable rates of output growth and unemployment and by an appropriate rate of inflation.''",2009-02-20 00:00:00,"4fd299028eb7c8105d8768a8","http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/opinion/20krugman.html"

Mathematically, if the overall economy were to grow 10 percent annually, and the 70 percent of the economy that is based in rural areas were not growing (as stated by the Chinese government), the economy in China's cities would have to be growing by 33 percent a year.

"By most appearances, the year just ended was a bad one for ''bling bling.'' A slang term that has made its way from hip-hop culture to the mainstream, bling blinging is most easily understood as flaunting that $1 million Piaget diamond-crusted watch. It doesn't tell time any better than a plastic Casio; it does send a clear message that the wearer has money to burn. The phrase was popularized in a song by rappers from the Cash Money Millionaires stable and was in part a catalog of obnoxiously flashy possessions (a private plane, for example). Of course, that song dates from 1999 -- the good old days, when rap artists were hardly the only ones bingeing. Twenty-something stock tycoons, Wall Streeters and various staid old white guys in charge of huge corporations bling-blinged all through the 1990's, and nobody complained. That was partly because they seemed to be fueling an economy that was good for everybody and partly because so many people saw skyrocketing individual wealth not so much as a problem but as something to get in on. It is only natural that a couple of years of crashing stocks, rising unemployment and corporate fraud -- and, of course, the wrenching personal reprioritization that Sept. 11, 2001, inspired in many -- might turn us into a nation of Thorstein Veblens, with little tolerance for such conspicuous consumption.",2003-01-19 00:00:00,"4fd26cea8eb7c8105d825e93","http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/19/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-1-19-03-close-reading-when-diamonds-and-escalades-are-ok.html"

"President Reagan's push for tax increases this year has shattered the business coalition that helped bring about the President's tax cuts in 1981 and is now pitting his natural allies against each other. Nothing has symbolized the split more than the break in the ranks of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. While the chamber, its president, Richard L. Lesher, and its executive board oppose the tax increase, the chamber's chairman, Paul Thayer of the LTV Corporation, supports the tax bill.

In the context of the depressed housing market, for example, a 13 percent or even a 12 percent yield on 30-year Treasury bonds would still be so high that interest rates on home mortgages would stay at 14 percent or higher - a rate that keeps monthly mortgage payments out of reach for many potential buyers.

"Confronted with increased evidence that the economy is stalling, the Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point yesterday, stunning investors and sending a powerful signal that the Fed is worried about the prospects for keeping the decade-long expansion alive. Acting between scheduled meetings, and with barely disguised haste, the central bank cut its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 6 percent from 6.5 percent. In a statement, it then signaled that it was likely to cut rates further in coming weeks and months. ''There's a simple message,'' Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said. ''The Fed will do whatever it takes to keep the U.S. economy from going down the tubes.'' The action, announced just after 1 p.m., caught most investors flat footed. It set off a strong rally on Wall Street, where lower rates are seen as a powerful antidote to the months-long tumble in stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 299.60 points, a gain of 2.8 percent, to close at 10,945.75. The Nasdaq composite index, which has seemed at times to be in free fall over the last few months, surged 324.83 points, or 14.2 percent, to 2,616.69. It was the Nasdaq's best day on record in both point and percentage gains. The Fed's announcement came two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect George W. Bush, who was meeting with business executives in Austin, Tex., to build support for his $1.6 trillion tax cut proposal. Mr. Bush has been warning of an economic downturn, and in welcoming the Fed's action yesterday he said it in no way reduced the need for a tax cut. Although the full effects of the rate cut are not likely to be felt for months, the action immediately began putting downward pressure on the rates paid by businesses and consumers to borrow money. Still, it is impossible to know with certainty when credit card rates will be affected. The rate reduction was an abrupt turnabout for the Fed, which only months ago was far more worried about the prospect of an overheating economy igniting inflation than about the possibility of a recession. Yesterday's move followed six rate increases between June 1999 and May of last year. It was the first rate reduction since November 1998, the first half-point rate cut since 1992 and the first time the central bank has changed policy between meetings since October 1998, a time when the global financial crisis was threatening the United States. The Fed had hinted last month that a rate cut was in the cards. But in taking its action four weeks ahead of its next scheduled meeting on Jan. 30-31, and in opting to cut rates by half a point rather than by a quarter point, its more normal increment, the Fed conveyed the clear impression that it saw economic conditions deteriorating faster than it or most analysts had anticipated. It is unclear why Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, chose to act yesterday instead of waiting until the next regular meeting at the end of the month -- whether he knew something about the economy not evident to everyone else. In a statement, the Fed cited a variety of factors, including weakening sales and production, falling consumer confidence, skittish financial markets and high energy prices. Clearly, the economy has weakened since the Fed policy makers last met, on Dec. 19, and left interest rates unchanged. ''Consumers are retrenching, business is pulling back, manufacturing is in recession, and banks have become more cautious,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, a forecasting and consulting service. The Fed move came a day after the National Association of Purchasing Management released the December results for an index that measures activity in the manufacturing sector. The index fell to 43.7 last month from 47.7 in November, leaving the measure at its lowest level since the end of the last recession nearly a decade ago. ''They saw the N.A.P.M., and it scared the pants off them,'' said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. The downward spiral in the stock market is also likely to have concerned Mr. Greenspan, who in recent years has made much of the tight links between what happens in the financial markets and the health of the economy in general. Investors have become increasingly convinced that Mr. Greenspan will step in with a rate cut whenever the market shows signs of deep trouble. Yet for months, Fed officials have insisted that interest rate policy has been aimed at controlling inflation, and not the stock market. The half-point cut yesterday, however, was clear recognition of the stock market's enormous power to make the economy boom or bust. ''The data for the real economy is not yet that frightening,'' said Peter Hooper, chief domestic economist for Deutsche Bank North America. ''But if the markets continued down on the basis of fear feeding on fear, that could push us into recession. And that got the Fed acting today.'' The Fed's rate cuts are traditionally aimed at stimulating economic growth by making credit less expensive, thus encouraging people to borrow and spend, particularly for homes, cars and appliances, three pillars of the economy. But weeks or months can pass before a Fed rate cut actually lowers borrowing costs for individual Americans. This time, the Fed, in cutting rates in such a highly noticeable way, seemed to seek faster action, economists said. The rate cut may lift the spirits of investors, with the hope that a rising market will raise the confidence of consumers everywhere. ''Consumers had become concerned because they thought the economy was slowing down too fast, and that would affect their job prospects and security,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. It also appeared that Mr. Greenspan had concluded that the release of unemployment figures for December on Friday would show further signs that what started as a modest slowdown was threatening to deteriorate into a downturn in which the economy would actually shrink. The Fed usually has one component of the unemployment report a few days in advance, providing a sense of employment trends among manufacturers. But the full employment report is not disclosed to the Fed until the afternoon before it is released. ''If the employment report came out even moderately negative without a response from the Fed, you could have a tremendous sell-off in the stock market,'' Mr. Hooper said. It is very unusual, but by no means unprecedented for the Fed to act between meetings. Mr. Greenspan has the authority to raise or lower rates on his own between meetings, without a vote from the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's 12-member policy-setting body. He last did so in October 1998, when he cut rates by a quarter of a point during a period in which the Fed was trying to keep the global financial crisis from spilling over into the United States. The previous inter-meeting move was in April 1994, when he raised rates by a quarter point as part of an aggressive yearlong campaign of rate increases. In this case, Mr. Greenspan decided on Tuesday to hold a conference call among members of the committee yesterday morning to discuss cutting rates immediately. The call started at 11 a.m. and lasted about an hour. Departing from normal practice for a rate cut between meetings, Mr. Greenspan asked for a formal vote of the committee rather than acting on his own authority. The precise outcome of the vote will not be disclosed until minutes of the call, along with minutes of the last meeting in December, are released together on Feb. 1. The hastiness of the decision to cut rates was underscored by the way the Fed handled the other interest rate it controls, the discount rate on loans to banks by the Federal Reserve system. Although the discount rate is usually kept below the federal funds target rate, the Fed often moves the two rates up and down more or less in tandem. But while the central bank cut the federal funds rate by half a point yesterday, it only cut the discount rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.75 percent. It did so because, under the central bank's procedures, changes in the discount rate are prompted by requests from the Federal Reserve banks -- and no bank had thought to ask, before yesterday, for more than a quarter-point reduction in the discount rate. As a result, the Fed said it would act soon to cut the discount rate again by another quarter point, once it got a formal request from one or more of the banks to do so. The Fed made clear that yesterday's action was likely to be the first step in a series of rate cuts intended to prolong an expansion that became the longest on record last February. The economy has been growing without interruption since March 1991. In its statement yesterday, the Fed signaled that the central bankers believed that further rate cuts would probably be necessary, perhaps as soon as the regularly scheduled meeting on Jan. 30-31. ''One of the main reasons for moving now is that it gives them a chance to ease again at the end of the month,'' Mr. Steinberg said. Even as it took strong action to head off a recession, the Fed offered a few reassuring words. It noted that there is almost no inflation, and it suggested that Mr. Greenspan's faith in the economy's long-term potential was unshaken, noting that ''there is little evidence to suggest that longer-term advances in technology and associated gains in productivity are abating.''",2001-01-04 00:00:00,"4fd20f078eb7c8105d78128e","http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/04/business/rate-cut-overview-federal-reserve-reacting-signals-slowdown-cuts-key-rate-half.html"

His new economic program, announced Sunday, focuses on ways to rebuild America's economy, but its most significant change from previous plans was Mr. Clinton's scaling back on his call for a middle-class tax cut, which he had long insisted was needed as a matter of fairness.",1992-06-23 00:00:00,"4fd1b40f8eb7c8105d6d82e3","http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/23/us/1992-campaign-assessment-clinton-s-retreat-change-tax-cut-for-middle-class-could.html"

"DEJA VU VOODOO Bob Dole, Tax Busting Mr. Dole, sailing to the Republican nomination in San Diego but sinking in the polls, reached for the magic vitamin that has revived many a Republican campaign: tax cuts. And not a dinky one at that. He pledged to cut income taxes by 15 percent and to spur economic growth to 3.5 percent. Naturally, this is all part of a plan to balance the budget. The old Bob Dole ridiculed tax cuts without spending cuts -- what he called ''gain without pain'' -- but now that he is a self-declared optimist, he plans to lop off all sorts of unspecified programs to ''roll back the empire of liberal, big spending'' government. For spice, he also compared the I.R.S. to the K.G.B. BEYOND NO-FAULT Cutting Car Insurance While he's harpooning political points, the Republican candidate is also espousing a big change in auto insurance. The savings could be so immense to drivers -- upwards of $40 billion a year -- that the issue could well have legs politically. Trial lawyers are against it, so many politicians, especially Republicans, would see that as a plus. The plan would give drivers the option of buying no-frills coverage, omitting insurance for pain and suffering. That could save individuals hundreds of dollars a year in premiums. FAMILY FORTUNES A Micro Tax Why wait for Washington to cut taxes when you can as good as abolish them now? J. R. Simplot, the potato magnate behind the volatile chip maker Micron Technologies, found a way for his family company to sell a lot of Micron stock without paying $39 million in capital gains taxes for six years. Tax avoidance of this sort is legal, but a source of consternation to the Clinton Administration. The maneuver also allows the family company to retain voting rights on most of the shares sold. Mr. Simplot, who is 87, long boasted that he had been a buyer of Micron, but never a seller, but since last fall the stock has tumbled, and he evidently decided to pull back. After the sale of 6 percent of Micron, the family apparently still owns 15 percent, worth $800 million. THE OPEN MARKET Nasdaq Under Duress Nasdaq brokers fixed prices for years, the S.E.C. charged, and all the while the problem was ignored by the exchange's oversight body. The Securities and Exchange Commission censured the stock market and the self-regulatory National Association of Securities Dealers, and one commissioner said the anticompetitive practices might have resulted in tens of millions of dollars of overcharges. Nasdaq is the second-largest exchange in the world in the dollar value of stocks traded, after the New York Stock Exchange, and has climbed to prominence with a roster of leading technology companies like Intel and Microsoft. The Government did not charge any individual brokerage firms criminally, at least yet, but required the N.A.S.D. to spend $100 million to improve monitoring to prevent abuses. The exchange, which essentially is a computer system that links brokers who then trade by phone, accepted the censure without admitting or denying the charges. But many Nasdaq traders are outraged by rules the S.E.C. is proposing to guarantee that investors get the best possible price in trading, saying they would devastate brokerage profits. LOGGING OFF A Day Off in Cyberspace The lights went out at America Online, leaving its six million customers out of commission for most of a day. In the process, small-business and home-office workers discovered just how much they depend on E-mail, and some were irate. ''This is a great way to burn customer loyalty,'' said Gary Arlen, the head of a market research firm. But crashes have long been part of the on-line world, and others approached the disruption more calmly. David Gardner, who with his brother founded the personal financial site Motley Fool on America Online, said: ''I've come to accept that from time to time computers break down. But if it goes on more than a day, I'll be very upset.'' Steve Case, the company's chairman, issued a mea culpa to customers but also saw a silver lining. A decade ago, on-line services were the turf of computer hobbyists. Now they are so much a part of everyday life that a day without A.O.L. ''is disorienting and downright frustrating.''

"Ben Bernanke's first exposure to monetary policy was reading the works of Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate. That was 30 years ago, when Bernanke was a graduate student at M.I.T., and he has been studying central banking ever since. By the time President Bush nominated him to run the Federal Reserve, at the end of 2005, Bernanke knew more about central banking than any economist alive. On virtually every topic of significance -- how to prevent deflationary panics, for instance, or to gauge the effect of Fed moves on stock-market prices -- Bernanke wrote one of the seminal papers. He championed ideas for improving communications between the Fed -- whose previous chairman, Alan Greenspan, spoke in riddles -- and the public, believing that clearer guidance about the Fed's aims would help the economy run more smoothly. And having devoted much of his career to studying the causes of the Great Depression, Bernanke was the academic expert on how to prevent financial crises from spinning out of control and threatening the general economy. One line from his ''Essays on the Great Depression'' sounds especially prescient today: ''To the extent that bank panics interfere with normal flows of credit, they may affect the performance of the real economy.'' Bernanke, who came to the job with a refreshing humility -- a desire to be less an oracle like Greenspan than a plain-speaking technocrat --faces exactly this sort of crisis now. Ever since last summer, a meltdown in financial markets has led to daunting losses in the banking industry and throughout Wall Street. Despite having written extensively on how to deal with such episodes, Bernanke has thus far been unable to reinstill a sense of confidence. His faith in modern forecasting models notwithstanding, he failed to foresee that the sudden rise in homeowner defaults, which triggered the crisis, would have such far-reaching effects. And the monetary medicine that he has prescribed, including some of the very tools that he lovingly detailed in his research, have yet to produce a turnaround.",2008-01-20 00:00:00,"4fd282298eb7c8105d84f206","http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20Ben-Bernanke-t.html"

"The Inventors Association of Manhattan meets on the second Monday of each month in the conference room of a Times Square law firm.

Gathered around the room that evening were 55 people, old and young, in suits and T-shirts, everyone hoping that his or her idea could buck the odds. Chris Landano, a young, wiry firefighter, told me about his TrakPak360, a utility belt -- perfect for photographers, carpenters, ''anybody who carries tools!'' -- which is equipped with a plastic track that allows pouches to swing around easily. Lorraine Muriello, a woman from New Jersey, described her borderline-brilliant (but extremely easy to rip off) idea: No Sweat Towels, gym towels with zippered pouches for keys and cellphones.

"Every congressman knows that the United States currently runs large ''twin deficits'' on its budget and current accounts. Deficit 1, as we well know, is just the difference between federal tax revenues and expenditures. Deficit 2 is generally less well understood: it's the difference between all that Americans earn from foreigners (mainly from exports, services and investments abroad) and all that they pay out to foreigners (for imports, services and loans). When a government runs a deficit, it can tap public savings by selling bonds. But when the economy as a whole is running a deficit -- when American households are saving next to nothing of their disposable income -- there is no option but to borrow abroad. There was a time when foreign investors were ready and willing to finance the U.S. current account deficit by buying large pieces of corporate America. But that's not the case today. Perhaps the most amazing economic fact of our time is that between 70 and 80 percent of the American economy's vast and continuing borrowing requirement is being met by foreign (mainly Asian) central banks.",2005-03-13 00:00:00,"4fd257208eb7c8105d801838","http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/13/magazine/13WWLN.html"

"IS military spending beneficial or harmful to the national economy? As noted in a recent column, Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger, though stressing that the fundamental reason for the rapid military buildup is to respond to the Soviet threat, still maintained that military spending was beneficial to the economy. He asserted that every $1 billion in military spending (measured in constant 1982 dollars) would create 35,000 industrial jobs. The Pentagon economists who initially gave that figure to Mr. Weinberger now suggest that it is low, with the true relationship, based on their use of input-output analysis derived from the work of Prof. Wassily W. Leontief, a Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist, that each $1 billion in military spending will create 50,000 to 60,000 jobs. Critics of the Reagan Administration's economic policies consider it ironic that Republican policy makers who reject Government spending as a support for the economy in all civilian areas accept it as beneficial in the military area.",1982-09-22 00:00:00,"4fd1234b8eb7c8105d5e7237","http://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/22/business/economic-scene-cost-effective-job-creation.html"

The law increases unemployment benefits by $25 a week and allows states to extend those benefits through the end of the year. It also provides $7 billion to the states to cover more than 500,000 workers -- often part-time, low-wage and female -- who are denied jobless benefits under outdated rules that apply in many states.

The region as a whole -- including Nassau and Suffolk Counties, Westchester and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut -- has an output of nearly $900 billion annually, making it the seventh-largest economy in the world, behind China and bigger than Canada or India.",2005-07-31 00:00:00,"4fd25c828eb7c8105d80a473","http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/opinion/nyregionopinions/31LIflorida.html"

This explanation makes sense, however, only if those in power have an extremely naïve understanding of their own interests. A careful reading of the evidence suggests that even the wealthy have been made worse off, on balance, by recent tax cuts.

"THE failure of Congress last week to reach agreement on a package to stimulate the economy raised some fears that the recession, the first in a decade, could linger well into next year. But not all forecasters view the deadlock in Washington as bad news. Gail D. Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a business-sponsored research group in New York, has become less pessimistic about the economy than she was a few months ago. She spoke on Thursday about the stimulus package in Congress and the economic outlook. Here are excerpts from the conversation. RICK GLADSTONE Q. Will the inability of Congress to reach a deal this year on a stimulus package hurt the economy? A. Actually, the economy was beginning to rebound before the attacks, and as we look at the economy over the last three months, we're setting a stage for a move back to growth in the first quarter. I think people will be surprised at how modest the decline is in the fourth quarter. Retail numbers have been going up and prices are going down. That is coming out of inventories. And durable-goods orders suggest that business spending and investment did not decline faster in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. When you add all this up, the consumer sector is going to look surprisingly strong in the fourth quarter. So, it's not a great market. You can't just put out the cheese -- you have to discount the cheese. But people are out and they're spending money. Q. Is it too late for Congress to help the economy recover? A. Had this all come much sooner, it could have helped to reduce the risk factor that everyone, including myself, had assigned to the economy. You had to, in the aftermath of Sept. 11, create some possible outcomes that were pretty dire. And so if the government had stepped in, say, in the middle of October, or even in the beginning of November, with a stimulus package, it would have given consumer confidence and business confidence a kind of a lift -- yes, help was on the way, and you could discount some of the worst outcomes. This may turn out to be, in terms of absolute duration, one of the shorter recessions, and it may turn out to be one of the mildest. I'm old enough to remember when things were really, really bad. Back in 1981-82, we had 10 percent unemployment. We haven't got to there. Q. The stimulus package would have given billions of dollars in tax breaks to businesses. Which ones lost out the most? A. The most capital-intensive businesses -- airlines, basic commodities, basic industry, the steel industry -- almost anybody outside the service sector that's investing in high tech. The losses are pretty much according to the level of capital investment as a share of total spending. But their cash flow turned positive in third quarter and more positive in fourth quarter. This would have added to improvement in cash flow. We will get to where we would have been, but more slowly. Q. Do you expect another tax-cut bill, including corporate tax breaks, before 2004? A. I don't think so. I think there was a pretty strong rationale, given the credit squeeze, of trying to put cash in businesses' pockets. Once you initiate a tax bill, it literally snowballs, so it's impossible to keep a tax bill from becoming a Christmas tree. Can you have that with other things riding along? It's hard to make that case, because we're moving back into a more profitable corporate environment. So some of the urgency one might have felt in the last six months, certainly the last six weeks, dissipates. Q. Many investors expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates around the middle of next year. What is your view? A. The Fed could take rates from 1.75 percent to 2.5 percent, I would think around the middle of 2002, the third quarter, but then I think the Fed could hold rates constant for quite a while. I view this recovery as rather sort of flattish -- we will move back to positive growth, but a 1 or 2 percent growth range for nine months or so. So while the Fed might redress its exceptionally low rates, the notion they will go into a tightening phase is just misguided.",2001-12-23 00:00:00,"4fd267678eb7c8105d81cd43","http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/23/business/five-questions-for-gail-d-fosler-even-without-stimulus-plan-outlook-brightens.html"

"WASHINGTON THE continuing effort by Congress to nudge the Federal Reserve in the direction of lower interest rates - but nothing inflationary, please - has taken an interesting turn in the last few days. The tip-off was the introduction of a resolution by Senator Robert C. Byrd, leader of the Democratic minority, calling on the Federal Reserve ''to achieve and maintain a level of interest rates low enough to generate significant economic growth and thereby reduce the current intolerable level of unemployment.'' That is the pivotal language in Senate Concurrent Resolution 128, which is a mild substitute for Senator Byrd's earlier bill, the Balanced Monetary Policy Act, that would have required the Fed to set targets for interest rates. The West Virginia Democrat has retreated to more innocuous language with the expectation of Republican support and because he knew that his bill, as distinguished from his resolution, had no chance of being passed in the three-week special session that began last Monday.",1982-12-06 00:00:00,"4fd12a8f8eb7c8105d5f2fcd","http://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/06/business/washington-watch-a-new-tactic-for-low-rates.html"

"To the Editor: In a letter entitled ""A Better Way to Reward Quality"" (Nov. 11), reference was made to the British solution to this problem, namely, the ability of any British manufacturing facility to participate in a quality program offered by the British Standards Institute. The measure of achievement offered by this program is registration in the BS 5750 Series of Quality Assurance Standards. To make this program available worldwide, the International Standards Organization developed the ISO 9000 Series Standards based on BS 5750. The international acceptance of ISO 9000 has established this standard as the new benchmark for quality. In the United States, Underwriters Laboratories Inc. and other quality system registrars -- including the American Gas Association and the National Sanitation Foundation -- now provide registration in ISO 9000. In addition, a worldwide network of quality system registrars has been established to facilitate international acceptance of registration procedures. This network provides the mechanism for a manufacturer to obtain registration with any of the equivalent regional versions of ISO 9000. While the Malcolm Baldrige Award recognizes the achievements of a select group of American companies, ISO 9000 provides the means for any manufacturer to measure its quality system against an international standard. This approach was developed to promote quality on a global scale and reward all manufacturers who meet the standard. HARVEY S.

"To the Editor: Your Sept. 6 Business Day article on the latest public statement by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, highlighted his recognition that recent robust economic growth, coupled with little price inflation, has not been in accord with historical experience. As a result, the Fed's analysts are handicapped for lack of accurate data to work on. Fiscal policy is drastically tighter today than it was in the 1980's and early 90's. Thus, the Federal budget is no longer pouring huge amounts of excess liquidity into the economy, leaving the job of overall demand management to the Fed. On the contrary, fiscal policy is automatically draining away a large part of any excess liquidity through its shift toward budget surpluses.",1997-09-13 00:00:00,"4fd213978eb7c8105d78a98d","http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/13/opinion/l-don-t-fear-inflation-077186.html"

When Ronald Reagan was running for election, people believed that something had to be done. They felt we were headed for disaster. Reagan gave them something new.

"The evolving partnership between George W.

Indeed, Mr. Bush and Mr. Fox are working on an ambitious set of proposals that they hope to unveil during Mr. Fox's visit to Washington in September. On the American side, the package under consideration includes legalizing the status of some three million undocumented Mexican workers here and embracing a more ambitious temporary-worker program for future migrants. In the past, this page has opposed the idea of a new amnesty for Mexicans who have immigrated illegally to the United States in recent years. We expressed concern that legalizing their status would undermine the integrity of the country's immigration laws, which were reformed in 1986, and depress the wages of the lowest-paid native-born workers. We now believe that growing interdependence of the American and Mexican economies and the installation of a reform government in Mexico permit the adoption of new border policies, including a limited form of amnesty. If properly designed, these changes could sharply reduce illegal immigration and would present no threat to the economic welfare of native-born workers.",2001-07-23 00:00:00,"4fd227648eb7c8105d7b0331","http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/23/opinion/rethinking-mexican-immigration.html"

They would have been forced to alter their forecasts more if oil prices had slipped below $10 a barrel. Economists noted that the price of West Texas intermediate crude, the American benchmark grade, fell below $11 in late July and probably would have plunged below $8 if OPEC had not agreed on production cuts.

As the Administration denies that government has responsibility for increased aid to the poor, the cities, the elderly and the sick, there is the continuing assertion that such responsibility is more properly met by local communities and the private sector.

On the contrary, throughout the book he expressed contempt for his colleagues, with their naive belief that market forces still mattered.

"This has been the summer that liberal discontent with Obama has finally crystallized. The frustration has been simmering for a while -- through centrist appointments, bank bailouts and the defeat of the public option, to name a few examples. But it has taken the debt-ceiling standoff and the threat of a double-dip recession to create a leftist critique of the president that stuck. Obama's image as a weakling and sellout on domestic issues now centers on his alleged resistance, from the very first days of his presidency, to do whatever was necessary to heal the economy. ''The truly decisive move that broke the arc of history,'' wrote the Emory professor Drew Westen in this newspaper, ''was his handling of the stimulus.''

"IT may be hard to remember, but less than two years ago Tyco International and Enron were code words in corporate America for something very different than smoke and mirrors. They were, or so it was thought, the antithesis of the dot-com bubble. They made and sold real goods, be they burglar alarms and syringes in Tyco's case or oil and gas in Enron's, and they reported what everybody assumed to be real profits. As part of a wider boom in profits across corporate America, the two companies said they earned almost five times as much in 2000 than they had two years earlier. Last week, however, Tyco, a manufacturing conglomerate, joined Enron as a national symbol of corporate scandal.

"On a recent early spring morning, I made my way down to the appropriately poker-faced and austere building that houses the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In its sub-basement, 80 feet below street level, there is a vault that rests on the granite bedrock of Manhattan. ''No man-made floor could hold the weight of all this,'' Peter Bakstansky, a Fed spokesman, assured me. The vault holds 7,000 tons of gold. This represents the world's largest stash of the precious metal, and it is worth about $100 billion. To view it, you descend to an underground bunker and pass through a narrow passageway cut into a 90-ton steel cylinder. Like most people, I'd seen gold before, though only in small quantities -- a filling here, a vanity wristwatch there. In front of me now, stacked in bricks atop wooden pallets, lay some pretty serious bling. Gold is a majestic condenser of wealth. A standard bar is seven inches long, three and five-eighths inches wide, and about one and three-quarters inches thick. It weighs 27.4 pounds, and at the current market price -- roughly $420 a troy ounce, the unit in which gold is measured -- is worth about $170,000. As miraculous as gold is in itself -- it is soft, dense, ductile, sectile, highly conductive, all but indestructible and, of course, very beautiful -- when you look at any quantity of it, you immediately exchange it in your head for something else. One bar, college education; 10 bars, Brooklyn town house. The cage in front of me appeared fairly small. Filled to the ceiling with gold bars as it was, it might well hold the financial health of a nation in the balance.",2005-06-05 00:00:00,"4fd25e918eb7c8105d80db90","http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/magazine/05GOLD.html"

"IS this steep and long recession the cure for what ails business? Or is the cure worse than the disease? Subjective answers depend not only on one's social and political philosophy but also on how particular people or groups are affected. For the unemployed the slump is experienced as all cost, no benefit. For some businesses, confronting falling sales and mounting debts, a continuation of the recession can mean unmitigated disaster. But, for most businesses and the economy in general, the recession may be a restorative. One way of seeing this is to look at the stock market. The market, as measured by the major indexes, climbed by more than 20 percent from August through November, and, despite recent oscillations, has held on to most of its gains. Since the market collectively represents the capitalized value of future corporate earnings, this suggests that despite the weak recovery foreseen by the great majority of economists, with unemployment expected to hover around 10 percent in 1983, the market sees better profits ahead.",1982-12-22 00:00:00,"4fd12bca8eb7c8105d5f53ed","http://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/22/business/economic-scene-the-recession-as-restorative.html"

"THE DEINDUSTRIALIZATION OF AMERICA Plant Closings, Community Abandonment, and the Dismantling of Basic Industry. By Barry Bluestone and Bennett Harrison. 323 pp. New York: Basic Books. $19.95. THIS is an intensely irritating but important book. For all its 450 footnotes and its tables, much of ''The Deindustrialization of America'' is an ideological tract masquerading as objective research. According to the authors, the book ''originated in a research project commissioned in 1979 by a coalition of trade unions and community organizations concerned with the causes and consequences of plant closings all across the United States.'' A disinterested reader will feel compelled to quarrel every inch of the way. But the phenomenon the authors forcefully describe cries out for serious attention. Even though I found their analysis distorted, their explanations simplistic and their remedies of dubious efficacy, I commend their message to anyone interested in where America is and where it is going.",1982-12-12 00:00:00,"4fd12ccd8eb7c8105d5f6cad","http://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/12/books/where-has-all-the-business-gone.html"

But now, courtesy of researchers at Harvard, comes news that it is the economists who think the nation is in fine shape and everyone else who predicts doom and gloom. To a practitioner, this turnabout feels good.

In the process, rents would rise, making landlords rich and planting the seeds of ferocious, unending class warfare. It was definitely a dismal vision. It was also spectacularly wrong.

"Yesterday's good news on the job front, on top of strong growth in the last half of 2003, may finally signal that President Bush's economic recovery is on solid ground. There is still plenty to worry about. Unused production capacity continues to drag down business profits, and job growth, while finally rebounding, remains slow. Consumers have loaded up on debt and could be devastated by a spike in interest rates. But the economic tea leaves are more positive than they have been for a long time. If President Bush can maintain the recovery through his re-election campaign, he will be in rarefied company. Richard M. Nixon, in fact, may be the only recent president to accomplish this feat, timing a recovery from a midterm recession to coincide with his 1972 race. The reason this is so hard is that, despite all the bragging about creating jobs or speeding growth, presidents really have few economic tools at their disposal. Most federal spending is outside a president's direct control -- locked up in things like retirement programs that chug along pretty much by themselves. The same is true of taxes and interest rates. A president can set the agenda, but taxes are ultimately controlled by Congress.

Lawrence Chimerine, chairman and chief economist at Chase Econometrics, estimates that the rate rose even further, to 5.9 percent, in the second quarter. A high vacancy rate discourages construction of new multi-unit dwellings because it indicates that a glut is developing. Mr. Chimerine says he believes that the decline in demand for rentals reflects the growing tendency of young families - who often rent -to buy small, newly built ''starter'' homes.

Examining product lines from Louis Vuitton and Gucci developed right before the financial crisis of 2008 and during the recession, the researchers concluded that despite the predictable musings of the popular press forecasting diminished ostentation, showiness was thriving.

Prices were raised, and the profits of the companies hardly suffered as a result.

It would be comforting to believe that housing-market distress represents a normal, if painful, correction after a period of excess. But all housing trends -- in prices, sales, construction and foreclosures -- indicate a market that is likely to decline even more, and far more than is needed to erase the artificial gains of the bubble.",2011-04-27 00:00:00,"4fd2b8ba8eb7c8105d8ae120","http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/opinion/27wed2.html"

"IF you have been looking for a mortgage or thinking of refinancing one, you know that interest rates have soared in the last month. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note was 3.63 percent on Friday, up a half percentage point since June 13. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage is up to 5.52 percent, from 5.21 percent just a month ago. This surge, however, is less troubling than it appears. Some economists and analysts are worried that the rate leap will derail the housing and mortgage refinancing booms, which have carried the economy while business investment has been weak. But it is more likely that the housing boom will just slow down. The impact of the sell-off in the Treasury market should not be as disruptive as the popping of the stock-market bubble.",2003-07-13 00:00:00,"4fd22f1e8eb7c8105d7bd701","http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/13/business/portfolios-etc-the-surge-in-rates-won-t-short-circuit-a-recovery.html"

Grow as dirty as you want. Take your time. Because I think America just needs five years to invent all the clean-power technologies you Chinese are going to need as you choke to death on pollution. Then we're going to come over here and sell them all to you, and we are going to clean your clock -- how do you say 'clean your clock' in Chinese? -- in the next great global industry: clean power technologies.

"THE melancholy over Steve Jobs's passing is not just about the loss of the inventor of so many products we enjoy. It is also about the loss of someone who personified so many of the leadership traits we know are missing from our national politics. Those traits jump out of every Jobs obituary: He was someone who did not read the polls but changed the polls by giving people what he was certain they wanted and needed before they knew it; he was someone who was ready to pursue his vision in the face of long odds over multiple years; and, most of all, he was someone who earned the respect of his colleagues, not by going easy on them but by constantly pushing them out of their comfort zones and, in the process, inspiring ordinary people to do extraordinary things. There isn't a single national politician today whom you would describe by those attributes, which is why the fake Jobs obituary published in The Onion, the satirical newspaper, struck such a nerve. It began by saying: ''Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple Computers'' -- and the only American in the country who had any clue what he was doing -- ''died Wednesday at the age of 56.'' It went on to quote President Obama as saying that Jobs ''will be remembered both for the life-changing products he created and for the fact that he was able to sit down, think clearly, and execute his ideas -- attributes he shared with no other U.S. citizen. 'This is a dark time for our country, because the reality is none of the 300 million or so Americans who remain can actually get anything done or make things happen.'

"ALTHOUGH inflation has usually been considered good for the stock market, disinflation has proven to be even better. That is the lesson of the past several years and the biggest reason that more records may well be set in coming months, according to many professionals. The rate of advance in the Consumer Price Index has slowed to a crawl, and in some recent months has actually fallen. The index dropped four-tenths of 1 percent in both February and March, the first back-to-back decline in the nation's most widely followed inflation gauge in more than 20 years. For the first three months of 1986, prices fell at an annual rate of 1.9 percent, prompting some economists to predict that inflation at the consumer level could be as little as 1 percent this year and, barring a sharp rebound in oil prices or a collapse in the dollar, only 3 percent or so next year. This would be the best two-year performance since the halcyon investment climate of the early 1960's.

"A Sluggish Recovery For some time, most economic forecasts for 1982 have called for a weak first half followed by a building recovery during the last six months of the year. Although many analysts are still sticking to earlier projections, the prolonged conflict between tight monetary and loose fiscal policies may soon force those estimates to be downgraded sharply. There is little doubt the economy ended 1981 on a sour note. This week's preliminary report on fourth quarter G.N.P. should show that output declined 6.5 percent, says Robert Gough, an economist at Data Resources. And, in spite of recent signs of strength in some corners, Mr. Gough says output will drop another 2 percent during the current quarter. In theory, Mr. Gough says, the economy should bottom out by spring, as consumers begin to take advantage of lower inflation. However, high unemployment and a likely continuation of tough money policies by the Federal Reserve could dampen spending plans, and mute the strength of the rebound. Unless the Administration sharply reduces spending plans in the next two fiscal years, Data Resources' current forecast of 5.5 percent and 4 percent growth in the third and fourth quarters is likely to be slashed, he says.",1982-01-17 00:00:00,"4fd1203c8eb7c8105d5e0787","http://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/17/business/prospects.html"

The council drifts from topic to topic, never committing the Administration to very much and always leaving the reader with a rosy view of the future. Worried about recession? Don't be. The downturn is sure to be shallow and short; free enterprise will handle it. The council's devotion to unfettered markets borders on the mindless. First-year economics students learn that unregulated factories and families will ignore the effects of their energy consumption on the environment. But nowhere does this council call for higher energy taxes to correct a blatant market failure. More discouraging is what the report doesn't say. Worried about the growing gap between wages of college and high-school graduates? It isn't even worth discussing. Worried about slums, homelessness, crack babies? Turn your attention instead to intellectual property rights in Brazil or privatization in Czechoslovakia. Eastern Europeans and South Americans might find the report mildly interesting. But for Americans, only the up-to-date statistical tables at the back of the volume will justify the $12 price.",1991-02-14 00:00:00,"4fd1bc958eb7c8105d6e8678","http://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/14/opinion/blue-skies-for-mr-bush-s-economists.html"

"The Federal Reserve yesterday reaffirmed its strong commitment to averting a potential recession. The central bank, led by Alan Greenspan, cut the federal funds rate by a half-point for the fifth time this year. The rate, a key benchmark for short-term borrowing costs in the economy, is now 4 percent. Significantly, the Fed indicated in its statement announcing the move that it stands ready to cut rates even further because economic weakness remains a larger threat on the horizon than does inflation. It is worried about the decline in capital investment and corporate profits, weakening conditions overseas and the possible effect of stock market losses on people's behavior. The Fed's aggressive efforts to encourage spending by consumers and businesses come at a time of heightened economic suspense. Though slowing down, the economy's longest uninterrupted expansion is now in its 11th year.

"COMPANIES In a Changing Air-Travel Market, Delta Tries a Fresh Start It was the latest admission that the business of air travel has changed -- for good. Back when a plane ticket was a luxury item, not a well-worn commodity like a pair of jeans, airlines used to make a lot of money. But then came rough-and-tumble upstarts like Southwest, and travelers discovered they could save money. Other airlines have attacked costs to some extent -- whether giving workers part ownership in return for concessions, or creating separate no-frills mini-airlines. But last week Delta -- which has few union workers -- said, in effect, that it was starting from scratch, announcing a drastic cutback of up to 15,000 workers, 20 percent of its force. The goal: cut costs by $2 billion a year -- to get its crucial cost for a ""seat mile"" way down from among the industry's highest.

Stockman. Although Mr. Reagan insisted he did not want to subject his audience to a ''jumble of charts, figures and economic jargon,'' he set out to explain ''where we are, how we got there and how we can get back'' - in effect, laying out an economic primer that might lead the American public to understand and support his effort to ''turn things around.''

"AMID the frantic groping for an economic policy suitable to today's economic problems, it is easy to look back and wish for another John Maynard Keynes, a Renaissance man to whom both the economic problems of the day and their solutions were obvious. What is often overlooked, however, is that Keynesianism was not adopted instantaneously, in a clear burst of collective insight. It took years of discussion and debate and the ascension of a new generation of economists for Keynes's idea of the role of Government spending as the stabilizing factor in the economy to take hold. Although Franklin D. Roosevelt's initiatives, particularly the makeshift work relief programs, are sometimes taken as examples of Keynesianism, in no way did economic policy under F.D.R. reflect a consistent application of Keynesian doctrine. It was not until after World War II, more than a decade after the theory had made its debut, that the economics profession began to embrace it and the American Government to practice its tenets.",1981-03-22 00:00:00,"4fd121cc8eb7c8105d5e3a20","http://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/22/weekinreview/keynes-like-supply-side-theory-was-hotly-argued.html"

Both in his order of presentation and in the strength of his rhetoric, Mr. Reagan appeared to give top priority to curing what he called ''one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history,'' which, he said, distorts economic decisions, penalizes thrift, ''crushes'' the young and elderly alike and ''threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people.''",1981-01-21 00:00:00,"4fd121d68eb7c8105d5e420b","http://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/21/business/economic-scene-reagan-policy-quick-action.html"

Nowhere was this ideological fervor better reflected than in the White House Office of Domestic Policy, a traditional power center freshly under the control of Martin Anderson, a conservative ideologue and academic who had been toiling for the cause of Ronald Ragan since the mid-1970's.

Today, the job of Assistant to the President for Policy Development is in different hands.

"Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, in his first appearance on Capitol Hill since the President endorsed Federal Reserve policies last week, indicated today that he still had problems with the President's program. Despite the impression of harmony left by the President's statement opening his news conference last Thursday, Mr. Volcker, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, said he had concerns about the budget deficits projected in the President's program over the next several years and their effect on the economy. He also questioned the Administration's assumption that a dramatic increase in personal and business savings would eliminate the adverse effect of deficits on interest rates. Leading banks loweredtheir prime lending rate today by half a percentage point, to 16 1/2 percent, and further cuts were predicted amid declining costs for lendable funds.

"NOT so long ago, various economists were assuring their clients that come the first of July, the economy would burst out of the recession like a shot from a Roman candle. For July 1 is Tax Cut Day, the day when working Americans will find their paychecks a little fatter thanks to a 10 percent reduction in tax rates. Also on that day, people who receive Social Security benefits may be a little richer with cost-of-living increases that will add $27 to the average monthly payment scheduled to go into effect. All told, the tax cuts and Social Security increases are expected to pump $48 billion into the economy, at an annual rate. All that money might stop the recession if consumers spend it on automobiles, appliances and houses or even, from a strict supply-side view, if they put much of it in stocks, bonds or savings accounts. ''It will be an important shot in the arm to the economy,'' said Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. ''I can't assure you or anyone that the tax cut in and of itself is going to have a dramatic effect on the overall economy,'' Mr. Weidenbaum said, adding that ''It depends on what else is happening - for instance, where interest rates are.''",1982-05-02 00:00:00,"4fd11fcf8eb7c8105d5e00b4","http://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/why-the-tax-cut-worries-business.html"

The Fed, she asserted, ''must strive to keep the recovery going at a reasonable pace,'' because a recession would have grave consequences for savings institutions, agricultural banks, the Federal budget deficit and the principles of free trade. No Policy Change Suggested Miss Seger's remarks did not suggest that the Federal Open Market Committee made any policy change at Tuesday's bimonthly meeting.

The worry was that credit-starved companies would be forced to slash spending, weakening the already-sluggish economy. The F.O.M.C. had to decide whether to nudge interest rates down, a move that would loosen credit and might keep the economy from slowing more.

"THE ECONOMY From London to Cairo: A March Toward War? The week's events seemed as carefully orchestrated as a Sousa, or maybe a James A. Baker 3d, march: Tuesday, the British Foreign Minister warned that time was running out for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Wednesday, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said war was inevitable unless Iraq withdrew from Kuwait in two or three months. Thursday, President Bush ordered at least an additional 150,000 troops to the Persian Gulf. And, in Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Minister sounded a softer but still harmonious note by admitting the possible use of force. Traders, who sent the price of oil below $32 a barrel on Monday, raised it to $35.53 after President Bush spoke. On Friday, oil finished at $33.89, as market participants decided that armed conflict was unlikely for the rest of the year. William L. Randol, an analyst at First Boston, figures that oil supplies will be tight enough to keep prices at about $30 through the winter. He adds another $5 or so for rising fears of war. ""It's workable if nothing goes wrong,"" he said. ""But the history is that things do go wrong."" The Non-inflationary Recession The brighter side of this economic slowdown is that it is keeping higher energy prices from raising the cost of much else. Producer prices rose 1.1 percent in October, after even higher increases the two previous months. Take out food and energy, and core producer prices in October were flat. Economists say that, with a recession more likely, only a few industries like airlines can raise their prices. Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical Bank, said higher energy costs will show up instead in reduced corporate profits, wages and employment. If the last two oil price shocks increased inflation, ""this one may be more deflationary,"" he said. ""The pressures to discount prices because of a weakening economy appear to be winning out."" 'Big Green' Wilts Messages from a restive electorate: Let environmental issues wither, but let the tax battles resume. California's ""Big Green"" ballot proposition, described as the nation's most comprehensive environmental program, united many industries to help bring about its defeat. New York State turned down a $2.1 billion environmental bond act, leaving communities to pay for mandatory recycling and search for new landfills. While Republicans limited their off-year losses on Capitol Hill, Democratic gains in state capitals give them an advantage in redistricting come 1991. Voters handed over governorships to different parties, or independents, in 14 states, causing some governors to reconsider increased taxes. President Bush tried on Thursday to retread his no-tax pledge for the future -- ""It ain't going to happen, I'll guarantee you,"" he said. Democrats, sensing the President's weakness, talked of reviving their proposal for a surtax on the wealthy. An Early Christmas No wonder their wreaths and tinsel and tree ornaments are already up. The department stores desperately want Christmas shopping to begin. The nation's major retailers reported an awful October, with sales down 1.2 percent from last October at Sears, Roebuck, and down 4.9 percent at J.C. Penney. But at Wal-Mart, sales were up 25 percent. A Legal Cartel for Airlines To some travelers, it seems that the airlines are behaving like the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The International Air Transport Association agreed last week to raise fares 4 to 8 percent, after authorizing raises in the same range about three months ago. Washington has given United States airlines antitrust immunity for taking part in the group. Consumer advocates growled, but analysts said the airlines are sharing the pain. ""There is absolutely no gouging taking place,"" said Paul Karos, an analyst at First Boston. ""The industry isn't coming close to recovering its fuel cost increases."" The nation's airlines have also raised domestic fares about 9 percent since the gulf crisis began. With the economy weakening, Mr. Karos said, the airlines are unlikely to push prices higher unless there is war. COMPANIES Volvo's Car-Crushing Ads Backfire The roof has caved in on Volvo's advertisements. The Swedish company tried to dramatize the safety of its cars with commercials showing a monster pickup truck, emblazoned ""Bear Foot,"" crunching a row of cars and leaving only the Volvo intact. A dramatization it was: the Volvo roof was reinforced; the roof on another car weakened. When charged with false advertising by the Texas Attorney General, Volvo promised not to make unverified safety claims but said its advertising agency, Scali McCabe Sloves, had acted without its knowledge. Volvo ran disclaimers in several newspapers, while one executive bemoaned the public's failure to get a joke. Twisted Market The bond market's byzantine mechanics: A ratings downgrade for Citicorp debt on Monday raised prices for other issues, without hurting Citicorp itself. Citicorp's firmness was simple: traders had anticipated the downgrade, by Standard & Poor's. But investors did not let the misfortunes of the nation's largest bank holding company scare them into dumping other bonds. Instead, they bid up other issues, saying they expected a recession, with interest rates bound to fall. Then, on Wednesday, Citicorp tried to raise investor confidence in its own securities by deciding to redeem $275 million in preferred stock. Darryl Defects It's bad enough that several investment banks are talking about leaving New York City. But last week, Darryl Strawberry decided to move his business from New York to Los Angeles. The Mets offered their leading home-run producer $15 million for four years. Like some Wall Street managing directors who earn almost as much, he felt abused, maligned and cheated. ""I don't think the front office of the New York Mets appreciated Darryl Strawberry,"" he said. And so to the Los Angeles Dodgers for the chance to play in his hometown at $23.5 million for five years. ""I couldn't sleep,"" said Tommy Lasorda, the Dodgers manager. ""I was so excited."" Lasorda might not sleep much come this spring, either, because now he has to manage a guy whose temperament makes a Salomon bond trader seem blissful and serene. In Brief The Nieman-Marcus Group will not carry the General Cinema label. The General Cinema Corporation withdrew its $240 million, $14.40-a-share offer for the 40 percent of the retailer it doesn't own after several shareholders filed suits saying the price was too low. The Burger King Corporation helped end a boycott by a religious group with newspaper advertisements last week boasting of the company's support for ""traditional American values on television."" The group accused Burger King of sponsoring shows having ""gratuitous sex, violence and anti-Christian stereotyping. Prudential-Bache is laying off as many as two-thirds of its investment bankers as Wall Street firms continued to retrench. INTERNATIONAL Seoul Races to the Soviet Union The first brand name that passengers arriving at Moscow's international airport see is not Marlboro, Pepsi, or Sony, but Samsung, emblazoned on every luggage cart. South Korea is rushing to secure a place in the Soviet market before the Japanese arrive. While the Japanese try to settle a territorial dispute with the Soviets, South Korea has re-established diplomatic relations, arranging to buy Soviet raw materials and offer steel and electronics in return. On Monday, Ju Young-Chung, the chairman of the huge Hyundai industrial and construction group, met with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Kremlin. The South Korean press reported that Mr. Gorbachev asked for Hyundai's help in developing the Soviet Far East and easing shortages of consumer goods. Mr. Chung asked Mr. Gorbachev to help improve relations between the two Koreas. Progress on both fronts is likely. South Koreans hope to give their products the same cachet in the Soviet Union that Sony has in the West. One immediate problem with selling consumer goods to the Soviet Union, says Robert K. Kim, vice president of the Korea Fund, which invests in Korean securities: ""The Russians can't pay for them."" Bringing Phones to Poland Poland wants the fruits of its newly free markets to include a $15 billion telephone system by the turn of the century. The Government intends to abandon the state monopoly on domestic phone service, opening the field to Polish and foreign competitors. Communications Minister Jerzy Slezak said on Friday that the new communications system would increase the telephone count from 3.8 per 100 people to 30 in 10 years. Some 7,000 Polish villages are now without service. The Soviet Union has 15 phones per 100 people; the United States has about 50.

"THERE may be no topic that more reliably divides liberals and conservatives than the relationship between success and luck. Many conservatives celebrate market success as an almost inevitable consequence of talent and effort. Liberals, by contrast, like to remind us that even talented people who work hard sometimes fall on hard times through no fault of their own. It's easy to see why each side is wary of the other's position. Conservatives, for example, understandably fret that encouraging people to view life as a lottery might encourage them just to sit back and hope for the best.

"Not so long ago, American workers would suffer the sting of a recession by losing jobs or having their hours or wages reduced. They responded by taking part-time work, signing with temp agencies and just making do -- at least until the economy revived. Then they would pour back to work, their wages rising as employers competed for their services. Not anymore. Recent reports suggest that the economy is starting to sputter after perking along for the four years since the last recession. But whatever the economy's prospects, the latest stretch of growth shows that for all but professionals, executives, new college graduates, and the most skilled blue-collar workers, many problems that workers faced only in bad times have become fixtures in all times: Some wages are still falling, people must be ready to work 12-hour shifts and 6-day weeks, and no job is for keeps.",1995-07-03 00:00:00,"4fd1eb668eb7c8105d73b9bc","http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/03/us/job-insecurity-a-special-report-in-new-work-world-employers-call-all-the-shots.html"

The continued progress suggested that a significant share of the step-up in economic efficiency achieved during the boom of the late 1990's could continue over the longer run. But even though the stronger growth in productivity could lay the foundation for higher incomes, economists said the gains did not necessarily foreshadow a quick upturn in today's slack economy.

But instead, a flurry of statistics - today's report of a 4.3 percent growth rate from July through September is the latest - suggests that the economy has settled into a state of satisfied exhaustion, unknown for two decades, that experts call a ''soft landing.''

"To the Editor: The chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Michael Boskin, now acknowledges that ""after the longest economic expansion in the peacetime history of the United States, the country probably has entered a recession"" (Business Day, Jan. 3). The first part of that statement, referring to the 93-month-long upswing that began in November 1982, represents another neoconservative effort to rewrite history. It has been uncritically accepted by many, including your own economics reporters (see, for instance, ""Why It's Too Soon to Predict Another Great Depression,"" The Week in Review, Nov. 11, 1990, and ""Leading Indicators in 5th Drop: 1.2% November Fall Suggests No Early End to Downturn,"" Business Day, Dec. 29). Dropped from sight in this version of history is the record-setting 105-month expansion of February 1961 to November 1969. Escalation of the Vietnam War took place during the last half. What counts for economic purposes, however, is not whether warfare is being waged, but the degree to which military spending is stimulating the economy. During the first half of the expansion of the 1960's, the military spending share of the gross national product actually fell, from 9 percent in 1961 to 7.2 percent in 1965. By contrast, the first half of the 1980's upswing was powerfully assisted by the Reagan Administration's $2.2 trillion military buildup. The military proportion of gross national product rose steadily, from 5.3 percent when President Reagan took office, to a peak of 6.7 percent in mid-1986. If the expansion of the 1960's was prolonged by Vietnam outlays, as was certainly the case, it must also be noted that the expansion of the 1980's would have begun later than November 1982 in the absence of Mr. Reagan's ballooning military budgets. From July 1981 to November 1982 the United States economy was going through one of its two deepest post-World War II recessions to date, with unemployment reaching 10.8 percent and fixed business investment declining 15 percent. During these months only military spending was growing rapidly. RICHARD B. DU BOFF Professor of Economics, Bryn Mawr College Bryn Mawr.

"On Sept. 7, 2006, Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University, stood before an audience of economists at the International Monetary Fund and announced that a crisis was brewing. In the coming months and years, he warned, the United States was likely to face a once-in-a-lifetime housing bust, an oil shock, sharply declining consumer confidence and, ultimately, a deep recession. He laid out a bleak sequence of events: homeowners defaulting on mortgages, trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities unraveling worldwide and the global financial system shuddering to a halt. These developments, he went on, could cripple or destroy hedge funds, investment banks and other major financial institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The audience seemed skeptical, even dismissive. As Roubini stepped down from the lectern after his talk, the moderator of the event quipped, ''I think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that.'' People laughed -- and not without reason. At the time, unemployment and inflation remained low, and the economy, while weak, was still growing, despite rising oil prices and a softening housing market. And then there was the espouser of doom himself: Roubini was known to be a perpetual pessimist, what economists call a ''permabear.''

"OVER the last two years, the value of the dollar against the major currencies has dropped by more than 25 percent. With the dollar having depreciated so much, why haven't we seen a narrowing of the trade deficit, which in February (the latest month for which numbers are available) reached a new record of $61 billion? A dollar depreciation should bring about what economists call ''expenditure switching'': as the cost of imports rises, Americans should start buying more goods made at home; in turn, our exports become less expensive for foreigners, which means foreign demand for our products should rise. This shift in exchange rates and prices should eventually correct the country's trade deficit. But so far, Americans' appetite for imports has yet to slow. That's because, with the exception of oil, imports have not become that much more expensive. One reason is that about 30 percent of our imports come from countries whose currencies have either moved little (the Thai baht), stayed stable (the Chinese yuan) or fallen (the Mexican peso) against the dollar.",2005-04-27 00:00:00,"4fd24abe8eb7c8105d7e8eba","http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/27/opinion/27mann.html"

"At the beginning of the final phase of the presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush is clinging to the narrow lead in the polls that he has held the last two weeks.

The governor's standing is a tribute to his effectiveness at the debates, where he held his own against a more experienced, knowledgeable and aggressive opponent. If Mr. Gore is to win, he will have to build on his own assets, talk more about the Democrats' economic record and somehow sharpen his attack on Mr. Bush without alienating voters.

"RECENT calls for another federal stimulus package raise an important question: Before considering costly short-term measures to raise overall consumer demand, have we done enough to ensure that financial markets will work properly and lead us to recovery? For housing -- the sector at the center of the crisis -- the answer is no. But the good news is that it might be possible to improve the housing market and invigorate the economy in a way that won't require a costly stimulus package. In a normally functioning mortgage market, almost all homeowners would have refinanced their mortgages to take advantage of low rates. Yet today, low interest rates are doing little to stimulate the housing market because of other stresses, including declines in house prices, falling household incomes and banks' wariness of making loans.",2010-09-19 00:00:00,"4fd29eb18eb7c8105d881b6a","http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/opinion/19hubbard.html"

"Malt liquors and boots were among America's 10 largest industries at the beginning of the 20th century. A third of Americans worked in agriculture. Fifty years later, cars, aircraft and chemical manufacturing dominated the economy and only about 4 percent of Americans worked in agriculture. The United States started the century on an economic par with Great Britain. By the middle of the century, living standards were 50 percent higher in the United States than in Britain. Now, at the end of the century, Americans, mostly employed in white-collar jobs, account for only 4 percent of the world's population but for more than 20 percent of its output. The American brand of capitalism -- democratic, lightly regulated and full of opportunities for individuals to fail as well as succeed -- is widely seen as a model for others to emulate. As the end of the century draws near, there is no longer any doubt that the state-dominated economies that competed with capitalism for much of the modern era have failed. Less clear than many Americans might imagine, however, is which model of capitalism -- American, European or Japanese -- is likely to prove most dominant in the decades ahead.",1999-12-28 00:00:00,"4fd22d958eb7c8105d7baf88","http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/28/opinion/the-defining-styles-of-capitalism.html"

"When 1983 began, long-term Treasury bond yields were around 10 1/2 percent and experts were expecting those rates to help blunt any substantial economic recovery from the 1981- 82 recession. Instead, the recovery was stronger than expected, despite slightly higher short-term interest rates and an increase in long-term Treasury yields to nearly 12 percent. That experience has made those who would predict the direction of the credit markets next year a bit skittish. While there is widespread agreement that the economy will continue to grow next year, there is no consensus on what rates will do. The experts agree mainly that the second year of an economic expansion normally brings an increase in business and consumer credit demand that puts upward pressure on interest rates.",1983-12-30 00:00:00,"4fd133268eb7c8105d601fce","http://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/30/business/the-guessing-game-on-1984-rates.html"
"The smoke from the smoldering failure known as the deficit ''supercommittee'' spread heavily across Capitol Hill on Monday, allowing Republicans to obscure the simple truth about the failure to reach an agreement. The only reason the committee failed was because Republicans refused to raise taxes on the rich, and, in fact, wanted to cut them even below their current bargain-basement level. Republicans in Washington claimed Democrats refused to budge on entitlements. John Boehner, the House speaker, and Mitt Romney, a Republican presidential candidate, as if by rote, issued statements saying it was all President Obama's fault. But, had a single Republican on the panel endorsed even a modest increase in upper-income tax rates, Republicans could have won trillions in cuts from entitlements and discretionary spending.

"Prospects for the nation's economy this year, which many experts found troubling as recently as a month ago, have abruptly brightened with the sharp decline in oil prices.

Even more important, some economists say the country may be positioned to return to the kind of recession-free, low-inflation conditions it last enjoyed in the late 1950's and early 1960's, before spending for the Vietnam War and the soaring oil prices of the 1970's knocked the economy off balance.

Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., ''I thought that we might have a recession in 1987. But I've changed that.

"THE last time the United States held a presidential election amid the mass unemployment left in a financial crisis's wake, the challenger offered only a partial glimpse of what he would actually do in office. Mostly, he played the opportunist, attacking the incumbent party for spending too much and helping too little, for being indifferent to human suffering and for failing to balance the budget, for overtaxing and undertaxing and everywhere in between. He claimed to be offering a bold contrast of visions, but mostly he just relied on the unemployment rate to do his work for him. That challenger was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His 1932 convention speech -- the first ever delivered by a nominee in person -- was more detailed than the parade of generalities Mitt Romney offered last Thursday. But mostly it was a sprawl of unpersuasive economic analysis and highly convenient criticisms of the hapless Herbert Hoover. Hearing it or reading it, you would have known that F.D.R. intended to govern as some sort of liberal, as you would know from Romney's speech that he intends to govern as a conservative.

First, a net job-creation tax credit for the next two years could provide a powerful incentive for private-sector employers to speed hiring and create momentum for a jobs recovery. Private employers who increase employment would get a tax credit to cover a substantial share (say 40 percent) of the payroll costs of net new hires; they would get a check even if they didn't owe taxes. Such a tax credit would focus the incentives on expanding businesses, where the new jobs are more likely to persist, even after the subsidy expires.",2011-09-07 00:00:00,"4fd2a0b88eb7c8105d884d97","http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/opinion/help-displaced-workers.html"

Some of the President's proposals to cut the budget, consolidate and even eliminate some Federal programs and to turn back authority to the state and local governments mirror reforms many elected officials as well as scholars have been urging for years. But under the surface, many of the proposals now before Congress run counter in important respects to most of the reformers' plans for change - and to the policy of President Reagan's Republican predecessors. As a result, there is concern that the nation may wind up swapping old difficulties for new ones. Over the last few years, for instance, the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations has been painstakingly examining the growing Federal role. The panel, established by Congress to find ways to make the Government more efficient and composed of elected officials from all levels, urges consolidations of the kind Mr. Reagan has proposed.

So declared John Maynard Keynes in 1937, even as F.D.R. was about to prove him right by trying to balance the budget too soon, sending the United States economy -- which had been steadily recovering up to that point -- into a severe recession. Slashing government spending in a depressed economy depresses the economy further; austerity should wait until a strong recovery is well under way. Unfortunately, in late 2010 and early 2011, politicians and policy makers in much of the Western world believed that they knew better, that we should focus on deficits, not jobs, even though our economies had barely begun to recover from the slump that followed the financial crisis.

And for those on the progressive side of the political spectrum, these are hopeful times. There is, however, another and more disturbing parallel between 2008 and 1932 -- namely, the emergence of a power vacuum at the height of the crisis. The interregnum of 1932-1933, the long stretch between the election and the actual transfer of power, was disastrous for the U.S. economy, at least in part because the outgoing administration had no credibility, the incoming administration had no authority and the ideological chasm between the two sides was too great to allow concerted action.

"''I just came back from a tour of many of our country's depressed areas and I can tell you that watching mature men with good skills go on soup lines is not something I found very rewarding.'' This comment may sound like something right out of the 1930's, but in fact it was spoken in 1982 by Canada's Minister of Employment. The statement reflects a brooding suspicion in North America and Western Europe that a pervasive unemployment crisis may be at hand and that much of the industrial world will find it difficult to maintain a commitment to even approximately full employment. The problem does not discriminate among political ideologies. It is as much a challenge for Ronald Reagan's and Margaret Thatcher's free market as for Francois Mitterrand's Socialism. Moreover, the Western economies are so interdependent that one country cannot solve the problem in isolation from the rest of the system; and any gains from protectionism are likely to be short-lived. The unemployment problem is at the center of many of the most contentious issues dividing the major industrial countries - Japanese exports, the orderly running down of the European steel industry, the Soviet-West European pipeline.

"The President proposed the first budget under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing bill. The budget calls for outlays of $994 billion in the 1987 fiscal year, a spending increase of just 1.4 percent over 1986 and one that would result in a deficit of $143.6 billion - down 29.2 percent from this year and the lowest since 1982. Military outlays would increase 6.2 percent, so, as usual in President Reagan's budgets, domestic and social programs would be cut. The budget is also likely to heighten tensions between the legislative and executive branches over spending: Legislators have been leaning toward a tax increase; the White House flatly rejects that possibility, although the President did say he might consider an oil imports tax.

But in the last few weeks, some prominent industry executives, along with some Wall Street analysts and private economists, have raised strong doubts that the plan would deal as crippling a blow to the industrial heartland as initially thought. Although the President's proposal would scale back billions of dollars in investment incentives, many depressed companies have accumulated enough tax losses to keep themselves immune from tax changes for years. And others would find the cutback in investment incentives at least partly offset by the lowering of the corporate tax rate. Furthermore, many smokestack companies are no longer as capital-intensive as they once were.

Mr. Richman and the five other executives, who were selected by the committee because of their support for the Reagan plan, represent the kinds of companies - food, retailing and household products - that can take relatively little advantage of tax preferences allowed under current law and thus pay high taxes now.

"ALL last week, in his budget message, annual economic report and State of the Union address, President Reagan laid out the game plan for his second term. He means to consolidate the conservative revolution in public policy - he calls it a Second American Revolution - that he began four years ago. In fact, the Reagan revolution, which he suggests is a reprise of George Washington's, is meant to be the counterstroke of the Roosevelt revolution of the 1930's. Where Franklin Roosevelt sought to overcome the problems of the Depression by increasing the economic and social role of the Federal Government, Ronald Reagan has attacked ''stagflation'' - that combination of stagnation and inflation that dogged the economy in the 1970's - by cutting the role of Government and by relying increasingly on what he calls ''the magic of the market'' to generate strong economic growth. To date, Mr. Reagan's economic policies look like a striking success. The economy's performance was a major - perhaps the major - factor in the President's landslide re-election, and that victory has emboldened him to stay the course he began in 1981. As he envisions that course, a free-market economy, with steady growth and low inflation, will emerge from the changing tax system, from the deregulation of major industries and from cuts in long-standing Federal subsidies in many areas, including agriculture, housing and medical care.",1985-02-10 00:00:00,"4fd140348eb7c8105d617795","http://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/10/business/reagan-s-high-risk-growth-game.html"

"CONVENTIONAL wisdom tends to have a short life span.

Now, the United States is doing everything right; Japan, and Europe, everything wrong. Under this theory, the contrast between Europe and the United States is especially vivid: while the former struggles with high unemployment and an expensive system of social insurance, the latter is creating jobs, lowering labor costs and slimming and toning its corporate infrastructure. The current conventional wisdom came in for criticism last month at the International Seminar on Growth and Employment at Oxford University, a gathering of academics, activists, journalists and directors of progressive think tanks from the United States, Britain, Europe and Australia who came together to mull over politics and the impact of the globalization of markets. The notion that what appears to be working for the United States as it crawls back to economic health -- driving down wages for existing work and creating low-paid jobs -- should be the prescription for Europe does not sit well with progressives.

High youth unemployment is exacerbating radicalism in Western Europe.

In it, Weber argued that modern capitalism was ''born from the spirit of Christian asceticism'' in its specifically Protestant form -- in other words, there was a link between the self-denying ethos of the Protestant sects and the behavior patterns associated with capitalism, above all hard work. Many scholars have built careers out of criticizing Weber's thesis. Yet the experience of Western Europe in the past quarter-century offers an unexpected confirmation of it. To put it bluntly, we are witnessing the decline and fall of the Protestant work ethic in Europe. This represents the stunning triumph of secularization in Western Europe -- the simultaneous decline of both Protestantism and its unique work ethic.",2003-06-08 00:00:00,"4fd291678eb7c8105d86a167","http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/08/weekinreview/the-world-why-america-outpaces-europe-clue-the-god-factor.html"

Notwithstanding Johnson's powers of persuasion, which were recounted over and over here this week by dozens of his apostles, it is unlikely he could have shaken Mr. Murray, who believes that government programs designed to help the poor have worsened their plight and devastated the nation's values and economy. Nor was there any chance that Mr. Murray would change the views of men and women who had devoted the most memorable years of their lives on the programs Mr. Murray would like to scrap.",1985-04-20 00:00:00,"4fd14c328eb7c8105d62ab41","http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/20/us/aides-evoke-goals-of-johnson-period.html"

"SOCIAL SECURITY Fix the C.P.I.? After You Politicians are noisy sorts, ever willing to rant and rave on nice safe topics like coddling prisoners. Utter two little words, though, and they'll clam up in an instant: Social Security. You hear more and more these days that the Consumer Price Index -- which dictates the increases in retirees' checks -- badly overstates inflation, costing Uncle Sam and Aunt Samantha hundreds of billions of dollars. But fix the index? Political suicide. What of the Administration? It will consider it, it says, if there's a consensus. After you -- no, no, after you -- and politicians pile up in the doorway. Last week, though, Alan Greenspan said, in effect, get on with it. Fix the index, quickly. He may be the only person around with both the nerve to speak up and the weight to get things moving. STOCK MARKET Crash? File Under 'History' Are stock-market crashes ancient history? Today's investors must think so. Why else would they send prices higher and higher, entrusting their futures to this huge poker game? (There is even talk of putting Social Security money into stocks.) The idea of a price collapse is treated as distant, dusty, ''can't happen again'' history. If you doubt it, consider this: the New York Stock Exchange ticker tape for the first few minutes of trading on Oct. 29, 1929, was just sold for $5,000 to the Museum of American Financial History. On that fateful day, it seems, a Boston broker sensed that something historic was happening -- it was -- and squirreled the tape away. ''It can't happen again, it can't happen again,'' Dorothy says, clicking her heels frantically. INDEXED BONDS Take That, Inflation! So here's your choice: You can bet that stocks will keep up their run, or you can turn to something teddy-bear safe like Treasury bonds. Until now, the second choice seemed foolish: not only would you get meager returns, but inflation could knock you for a loop at any moment. Last week, with the advent of inflation-indexed bonds, it suddenly looked a lot less foolish. Yes, the return will be meager -- 3.4 percent now -- but that's a real, after-inflation return, guaranteed for 10 years. If prices rise, the value of your bond moves higher in lock step. Considering the tax angle, though -- you pay tax on your whole return, even the part you don't see for 10 years -- the bonds may be most appropriate for tax-deferred retirement accounts. BANKING Giving, on Credit The Roman Catholic Church is often accused of being behind the times -- on, say, women's rights. But in one area, it's at the forefront -- at least at San Claudio's Church in Leon, in northern Spain. San Claudio's, recognizing that ''the age of plastic money'' is upon us, has installed a bank machine in its entryway. No, it's not an A.T.M., exactly -- you give it money, not the other way around. Just pop in your bank or credit card, punch in what you want to donate -- and presto! The church gets its money without risk of theft, and you keep your privacy -- and have a receipt to show the tax collector. A local newspaper couldn't resist the headline ''Through Visa Toward God.'' TOBACCO 891 Billion Cigarettes In the fourth quarter, Philip Morris had net income of $1.47 billion, mainly because of growth in its international tobacco business that, in one analyst's words, ''defies gravity.'' In those three months, it sold 891 billion cigarettes -- about 156 for every human on the planet. SUPER BOWL ADVERTISING Men Behaving Strangely This, as the millennium looms, is the glorious height to which humans have evolved: a bunch of guys in bumpy outfits with numbers on them smash into one another for a couple of hours, occasionally throwing a ball around, and fully half -- yes, half! -- of the nation's population feels compelled to watch on TV. And advertisers spent, for the first time, more than $100 million -- a record $1.2 million, on average, for 30 seconds -- to entertain these cheering masses with such uplifting fare as soft drinks throwing street parties. This is evolution? 'STAR WARS' INC. The Force Gets a Paint Job How times have changed. It used to be that 20-year-old movies were relegated to the faded, flickering depths of, say, Manhattan's old Thalia or Regency theaters. But that was before the age of -- need one say it? -- ''Star Wars.'' Yes, ''age.'' The ''Star Wars'' series is no one-year or one-decade phenomenon. No way. With T-shirts and all, it's a $4 billion business -- even before ''Star Wars'' blasted into theaters last week, dusted off, redigitized, respectacularized, whatever it is George Lucas and his techie buddies do out on that California ranch. It'll make millions, of course -- perhaps $100 million. But that's a drop in the galaxy. This is all part of a master plan, with more merchandise, more marketing -- all building to that long-awaited next trilogy in 1999. BUDGETS Miracle of the Ballot Box What an astounding coincidence. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, after three tightfisted years, announced a preliminary budget last week that included his first overall increase in city spending and his fewest reductions in services. Practically as he spoke, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman -- a highly visible champion of slashing government spending -- proposed her own budget, one that increases spending for public schools and the environment. Could it, by chance, have anything to do with election calendars? TECHNOLOGY 90's Taxes, 60's Computers What pays most of this country's bills? Simple: $1.4 trillion in taxes. So considering how vital this money is, the I.R.S. surely has the best, most up-to-date computers around, right? Sadly, no. It has a crazy quilt of systems, some dating to the dark ages of the 60's -- and often those computers can't even trade information with one another. The agency recently spent $4 billion to make it all better, but last week it conceded that the system still didn't work, threw up its ink-stained hands, and proposed contracting out some processing of returns. And farewell privacy. CYBERMESS America on Hold Yes, yes, this is a painful coming-of-age period in the exploding on-line world -- someday (really!) things will get worked out. Right now, though, confusion piles atop confusion. Last week America Online, which had opened the electronic floodgates with its all-you-can-eat pricing, responded to the inevitable gridlock with an offer to compensate subscribers who couldn't dial in. Try to call for that refund, though, and guess what? You get put on hold. (We spend increasing chunks of our day, it seems, either on hold or trying in vain to fit our particular needs to the touch-tone choices allotted us.) So, what next at America Online?

"Rarely is the United States thought of as a country reliant on foreign trade, the way Japan is, or many European countries.

So important has trade become to the United States that, over the past year, as exports have shrunk and imports risen in the face of a strong dollar, the damage to the economy has been every bit as severe as that caused by the declines in housing and automobiles. And many economists predict that America's trade position will continue to act as a drag on the economy for at least the remainder of this year.

"Last month, five former Secretaries of the Treasury - Michael Blumenthal, John Connally, Douglas Dillon, Henry Fowler and William Simon - along with former Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson and about 500 other signatories published a ''Bipartisan Budget Appeal'' to the President and Congress. The appeal emphasized the dangers of the huge deficits pending in the Federal budget in the ''outyears,'' 1985 and beyond, and set forth the outlines of a program for bringing them down. The three major components of the program are a reduction in the planned growth of military expenditures, cuts in the social programs whose benefits go to people regardless of need - which account for no less than 39 percent of the total budget, including 28 percent in Social Security alone - and finding substitute sources for the revenues that the President and the Congress so profligately gave away in 1981. As two signatories of that document, we have been surprised by the abstention from it of several prominent Keynesian economists and by the criticism that its focus on budget cutting could undermine the needed recovery of the economy in 1983. After carefully re-examining the issue, we believe it is important to reaffirm our support for the appeal and, specifically, to reject the view that there is any inconsistency between its proposals and the imperatives of immediate economic recovery.

"A CENTRAL lesson of the Great Depression was that economies mired in deep downturns seldom recover quickly on their own. Consumers won't spend because they're worried about losing their jobs -- if they haven't lost them already -- and are busy paying down debt. Companies won't invest because they already have more than enough capacity to satisfy existing demand. That leaves government. It's the only remaining actor with both the means and the motive to bolster total spending substantially. Yet in 2009, when economic stimulus legislation was proposed in Congress, many people insisted that the extra government spending would do no good. They argued that the prospect of big fiscal deficits would cause consumers to save more to meet higher future tax bills, thus offsetting any stimulus effect.",2010-08-08 00:00:00,"4fd2b7398eb7c8105d8abdc5","http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/business/economy/08view.html"

"The usually sure-footed Adam Davidson stumbles when he writes: ''Every month, the United States buys around $35 billion in goods and services from China and sells around $11 billion back. That, of course, leaves a $24 billion trade deficit. Currencies work like any other salable good in that they adjust based on supply and demand. The natural result should be for the dollar to get weaker as the renminbi gets stronger.'' Not so. Just as foreigners need (and, hence, demand) dollars to spend on American exports, foreigners need (and, hence, demand) dollars to invest in America. Because a rising U.S. trade deficit often signals increased foreign demand to invest in America, it's a mistake to suppose that dollars that foreigners don't spend on American exports necessarily are dollars not demanded by foreigners for use in America. In short, a rising U.S. trade deficit does not necessarily unleash market forces that weaken the dollar against other currencies. DONALD J.

"Almost against the will of the participants, the competition for a share of world food markets has escalated to the point where it threatens to ignite a trade war among the industrialized nations. As an outgrowth of the prolonged worldwide recession, the competition to export farm products - which accounted for nearly 15 percent of the $2,000 billion annual volume of world trade in 1981 and 1982 - has become more bitter and more threatening. Faced with a depressed market for their industrial goods, nations have sought to take up the slack with agricultural exports; at the same time, they are attempting to check the flow of such imports into their domestic markets. As the issue has become more heated in recent months, many officials have warned that an all-out trade war will erupt unless some method is found to defuse it. The most recent, and strongest, such warning came last week from Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that such an outbreak would have a ''devastating impact'' on the world economic order.",1983-02-21 00:00:00,"4fd12c128eb7c8105d5f5cce","http://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/21/business/trade-war-feared-over-food-export-issue.html"

"Borrowing by consumers increased more than expected in January as spending picked up from a fourth-quarter lull and higher energy costs made repaying debt harder, Federal Reserve reports showed today. The rise of $16 billion in outstanding consumer debt, bringing the total to $1.5 trillion, followed a December gain of $7.2 billion, a Fed report showed. The rise reflected the largest increase in credit card debt since August. Other loans also increased. The numbers suggest that Americans are less discouraged by rising energy costs and job cuts than typical measures of confidence indicate. ''People don't borrow unless they are reasonably confident of their jobs and prospects,'' said William Sullivan, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. At the same time, the Fed's latest regional economic survey found evidence that people paid off a smaller portion of their credit card balances because of surging costs of electricity and natural gas used to heat homes. ''Higher energy costs also were cited as contributing to an increase in default rates on auto and home-equity loans, although this effect was expected to be transitory,'' the Fed survey, known as the beige book, said. Energy prices rose 3.9 percent in January, the Labor Department reported last month. The beige book, a compilation of anecdotal reports from 12 regional Fed banks, showed that the record economic expansion finished its 10th year with ''sluggish to modest'' growth and a declining demand for workers.

Now, however, that explosion in investment is showing broad signs of slowing. Corporate profits are falling in many industries, giving companies less money to spend. Banks have tightened their lending policies, raising the cost of money. And the swoon of technology stocks has forced the very companies that have made some of the most substantial investments in new equipment to reconsider how they operate.",2000-11-30 00:00:00,"4fd23df88eb7c8105d7d4411","http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/30/business/corporate-capital-spending-is-slowing-broadly.html"

"Of all the various forms of corporate subsidy that the American taxpayer is now being asked to shoulder (bailouts for swaggering investment bankers and insurers, lifelines for overextended homeowners and the mortgage lenders who took advantage of them), perhaps none evoke such complicated emotions in Washington as the comparatively modest plea of General Motors. This is not simply because of its size, but also because G.M. is bound up with our collective identity, both national and personal. No congressman looks back wistfully at the first batch of securitized mortgages he bought with his hard-earned savings during his teenage years or to losing his virginity in the back of his father's trading floor. Probably no senator thinks back nostalgically to the beloved uncle who proudly broke his back every day for 40 years working in the reinsurance business. To a lot of politicians and White House aides, G.M. isn't simply another failing company looking for a handout; it's as much a symbol of middle-class aspiration as the tract house and the Disneyland vacation. Of course, this deep familiarity we have with G.M. and its cars can cut the other way too. Recently, as politicians back in Washington were discussing a first round of public loans for the automakers, I rented a Pontiac in Southern California.

"Republicans have a right to their suspicions about President Clinton's calls for an end to harsh partisanship. Mr. Clinton never hesitated to slug them in the eye back when he had the Congressional majority to back him up. But a President without votes on the Hill must placate more often than threaten. So Mr. Clinton's ""common-ground"" speech at Georgetown University can be read by political realists as an attempt to make a virtue of necessity. The necessity, in Mr. Clinton's case, was created by his party's collapse at the polls in 1994. If 1996 is to be any different for the Democrats -- and more to the point, their standard-bearer -- Mr. Clinton needs Republican help in establishing himself as a bipartisan leader. Even allowing for this most cynical reading of the politics of his speech, the President is right on its core ideas. The ills afflicting American society do not flow from the fact that the middle class no longer possesses the moral perfection of, let us say, Jesse Helms and Phil Gramm.

"HOW can national economic policy aimed at curing ''stagflation'' avoid, on one side, the danger of pushing the economy into a depression and, on the other, regenerating higher inflation? The problem is exacerbated today by the overstrained debt positions of many companies, as indicated by liquidity ratios calculated by the Bank of New York. The classic remedy for a fragile financial structure is recession. For in a recession two things happen to improve the financial position of corporations: First, although cash flow is reduced, business outlays on capital goods and inventories shrink even more, so the ratio of cash flow to capital and inventory spending improves. Second, the level of both short- and long-term interest rates comes down, and the yield curve becomes positive, with short rates dropping more than long rates. Corporations, with long rates at their recession lows, then move to convert their short-term obligations into long-term debts, thereby strengthening their liquidity.

"Against some of the best economic advice in the land, President Bush and his Republican Congressional leaders have concocted a benighted final tax-cut plan that will do far more to deepen the nation's deficits and debt than to stimulate the wallowing economy. In a rush for approval by Memorial Day, the leaders have cannibalized parts of competing packages into a tentative $318 billion grab bag that again offers the most significant relief to the upper-bracket Americans so dear to the administration. Dividend taxes will be cut, not eliminated as the president hoped, but so will capital gains taxes. The latter was a conservative chestnut rejected two years ago when the first Bush cuts were enacted in the long-ago euphoria of an actual budget surplus. This time, with the budget hemorrhaging red ink, the G.O.P. takes care to include $20 billion in much needed fiscal relief for battered state and local budgets, whose problems can be traced in part to the first Bush cuts. And the leaders are wrapping their package in middle-class sweeteners like child-care credits and relief for married taxpayers. But those boons are cynically ''sunsetted'' to expire after three years to fit into fictitious limits of fiscal responsibility. In contrast, there is no such asterisk on the accelerated cut in all tax rates, including the most controversial drop in the top rate, to 35 percent from 38.6 percent -- a windfall of scores of thousands of dollars annually for wealthy Americans.",2003-05-22 00:00:00,"4fd242918eb7c8105d7db7b6","http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/opinion/the-republicans-party-on.html"

"Yesterday the Federal Reserve Board decided to cut interest rates for the sixth time this year in its continuing efforts to stimulate the economy. But this time it lowered its target for the federal funds rate by only a quarter of a percentage point rather than the heftier half-point to which it had resorted in the previous five cuts. The Fed's restraint is likely to signal a tapering off of its efforts to cut the cost of borrowing so as to encourage business investment and consumer spending. Given the mixed state of the economy and the risk that further rate cuts could lead to higher inflation, a wait-and-see approach to future cuts seems prudent. One reason for caution is that the Fed has not had much time to observe the effects of its past decisions. Changes in monetary policy typically take about six months to percolate through the economy, so even the first of this year's rate cuts is only now reaching the point where its effects should become noticeable. Over the past two decades, the Fed has enacted a series of rate cuts six times. In five of those cases there was an immediate jump in inflation right on the heels of the last cut. This historical pattern suggests that the Fed tends to overshoot and cut rates too much in its efforts to combat economic slumps. Overshooting could be especially dangerous now, since companies have not yet passed along all the recent, rapid increases in producer prices and wages to consumers. Consumer prices will inevitably catch up, and the Fed, which has already cut rates so low that it has little room for future rate cuts, should be careful not to add fuel to the fire.",2001-06-28 00:00:00,"4fd258748eb7c8105d803d13","http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/28/opinion/the-fed-turns-less-aggressive.html"

Unemployment has reached record levels for an election year and three Americans in ten expect it to hit their families this year, according to the New York Times/CBS News Poll. Conservatives are nagging that he has become too much a pragmatist. The Republican unity that formed a precondition of his 1981 successes is strained. But that ice will still support him. Those approval ratings are falling only gradually. Three Americans in five say they think his economic program will eventually succeed, an optimistic group that included half of those who feared unemployment in their family. The President's ability to avoid political damage from his own errors, like those that punctuated Tuesday's press conference, seems as good as ever.

Few analysts, moreover, expect the rate to decline appreciably in the near future, even if the current economic expansion, which is now approaching its fourth anniversary, continues. Yet for all the lost production and individual distress associated with having 8.33 million Americans jobless -more than the population of New York City - a 7 percent unemployment rate seems to have become acceptable to the public, some experts say. This comes after unemployment rates in the double digits from September 1982 through May 1983, reaching a peak of 10.7 percent in December 1982. A Sense of Well-Being The drop in unemployment along with the dramatic decline in inflation, also from the double digits in 1979 and 1980, has done much to restore a sense of economic well-being.

"THE drop in industrial production by half a percentage point in August implies that unemployment, which has held at 9.8 percent of the labor force for the last two months, is likely to rise above 10 percent before the November elections. The drop in production also lowers the rate of industrial capacity utilization, putting additional pressure on capital spending by business. For August, factory use declined to 69.4 percent, off half a percentage point from the low July level. Under the impact of excess capacity, industry has been cutting its capital appropriations steeply. Alan Greenspan of Townsend-Greenspan notes that, excluding highly volatile petroleum expenditures, manufacturers slashed their capital appropriations 17 percent in the second quarter and 34 percent in the last three quarters.

"The current economic recovery is nearly six years old, and the annual inflation rate is a meager 3.2 percent -- the lowest level since World War II for an expansion this old. Economists are coming up with all sorts of explanations for the unusual milestone. And gradually many are concluding that inflation has become harder to explain. The most striking aspect of this milestone is the scramble it is provoking among economists to repair the theory that they use to link unemployment and inflation. The theory, a keystone of economic policy, says that when the unemployment rate falls below a certain flash point, inflation soon accelerates. But the flash point foreseen in theory, 6 percent, was breached months ago, and nothing happened. The unemployment rate went as low as 5.1 percent, and still nothing happened.",1997-01-02 00:00:00,"4fd1fccd8eb7c8105d75c132","http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/02/business/the-link-grows-cloudy-between-jobs-and-prices.html"

''America's economy is ready to lead the world out of recession and into recovery,'' he declared as the workers cheered. But President Reagan on the campaign stump in the port of Long Beach, Calif., earlier this month was, in fact, very different from Candidate Reagan of two years ago. Back then, he joyously lashed President Carter and the Democrats for causing the nation's economic stagnation. Now, with the economy still floundering, Mr. Reagan finds his own policies under attack. The very day of his appearance at the shipyard, the Labor Department reported that unemployment had reached 10.1 percent, the highest level since the Great Depression. Republican Congressmen fear that the economic malaise will drag them down to a crushing defeat in the election next month, threatening the future viability of the Reagan Administration itself.

"CAMPAIGN '96 Promises, Promises Bob Dole, at last the official Republican nominee, played that old theme song, promising to ''get the economy moving again.'' In his acceptance speech, after discussing values like family and duty, he moved on to the good stuff: lower taxes, zippy growth, a balanced budget, lots more spending on the military, down with the I.R.S., up with the I.R.A. And one thing is sure: The White House in a Dole era wouldn't be populated by those lib kids at home there now, that boomer elite, as Mr. Dole said, ''who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and never learned.'' Not like their daddies. INFLATION ALERT What Blips Up Can Blip Down Traders woke from a sleepy August week to panic briefly on a report of a blip in consumer prices. They were up three-tenths of a percentage point in July, lifting inflation for the past 12 months to a whopping 3 percent. That and a report of strong retail sales, suggesting a heated-up economy, sent interest rates higher and stocks lower. Later, the Federal Reserve restored the status quo, saying industrial production edged up a mere one-tenth of a point in July, the smallest amount in four months. And new housing construction fell to the slowest level in four months. All that allowed traders to sneak off for their Friday golf dates. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week about where it began, at 5,689.45 points, up 8 points. BUY AND HOLD DEPT. Buffett Is It Warren Buffett is America's second-richest man, in fact the world's second-richest man, according to Forbes magazine, which is to the super-rich what People magazine is to Gwyneth Paltrow and Matthew McConaughey. (The wealthiest individual, of course, is that Microsoft fellow out West who defined geek chic.) When Forbes checked in last month, Mr. Buffett had added $4.6 billion to his net worth in the last year, or $125,000 a day, every day of the year, including Feb. 29. But even brilliant stock-pickers suffer reversals. The shares of his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway have fallen 14 percent since their high in March, and earnings slipped in the second quarter. Perhaps the market agreed with Mr. Buffett's candid assessment in Berkshire's annual report that the company's market price had grown even faster than its intrinsic value. The stock won big on a doubling in Coca-Cola's stock price. (Berkshire's Coca-Cola shares are now worth $10 billion, or 42 percent of its stock holdings.) Even if Coke's big run is over, Mr. Buffett's composure isn't likely to suffer. When he buys, he typically holds, and then holds some more. ENGLISH 101 And Watch Your P's and Q's Suffolk County, on eastern Long Island, is going to vote on a measure to pick an official language, deciding that would insure economic advancement. It follows the lead of 23 states and 15 cities that have picked an official language. But the vote will not be a multiple choice -- a) Chinese, b) Farsi, c) English. Actually, that choice was already made by county legislators. One said, ''If people want to partake of the American dream they have to know the language.'' Opponents say the county is overreacting to the 1.2 percent of its population of Hispanic origin who speak limited or no English. Whether or not the measure is the right dose of medicine, it is true that people ''who know English do a lot better in their earnings and employment,'' said George Borjas, professor of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. PICKING UP ROOTS Where Exactly Is Wall St.? If the Big Board moves off Wall Street, what becomes of Wall Street? Perhaps it doesn't matter, because the street is less an address than a metaphor, like Detroit, which people refer to as the focus of the automobile universe even while car plants spring up in Kentucky. Still, the idea of Wall Street without the New York Stock Exchange takes some getting used to. The exchange, which has been at 11 Wall since 1903, is beginning to cast about for bigger quarters to accommodate a much-enlarged trading floor for the electronic era. It intends to stay somewhere in Manhattan, though not necessarily downtown. Tough luck, Jersey City. BROWSER WARS And in This Corner . . . Compared to Netscape, Microsoft is in the uncharacteristic role of underdog, a position it does not want to get used to. The Netscape Navigator Internet browser is used by more than 85 percent of computer users for viewing pages on the World Wide Web. Microsoft is rushing to catch up with its Explorer browser, and the marketing war has begun. Microsoft's new version, available free on the Net, gives away subscriptions through Dec. 31 to the Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition, which normally costs $49 a year, and to the ESPNet Sportszone, which usually charges a la carte. ''If you look at how Microsoft built their franchise in operating systems, it was by adding applications and locking people in,'' said David Smith of the Gartner Group. ''Now content is the application.'' MEDICAL SCHOOLS Tune In, Drop Out Medical students pay much money to attend Cornell University Medical College -- except when Cornell pays them to stay out. Granted, it's a cockeyed arrangement, but Cornell somehow overbooked the incoming class by 15 percent. That forced the school to offer a one-time-only sale -- a tuition-free year, worth $24,000. It is available to doctors-in-waiting willing to put off enrollment a year. A few signed up, but others, ever rational, figured that even a big discount was outweighed by the loss of a year's future earnings, and that's real money in a most lucrative profession. While Cornell and other schools are bulging, some specialists say American schools are turning out too many doctors. MUTUAL FUNDS A Marketing Advantage Fidelity Investments intends to set up an insurance company to protect investors in its money market mutual funds in case of default by any of the security issuers.

"Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today that the economy's slide was drawing to an end and that the central bank needed to be especially cautious before deciding to try to hasten recovery through another round of interest-rate cuts. ""The evidence suggests that the economy is still modestly moving lower, but moving at a reduced rate,"" Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee. ""We do expect the bottom to occur within a reasonably short period ahead,"" he added. ""Week by week, the daily numbers still indicate that there is a modest decline."" Sign of Economic Weakness Mr. Greenspan's comments came shortly after the Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured durable goods tumbled 6.2 percent in March, a considerably worse decline than expected. This was the fourth decline in five months and the biggest since an 11.2 percent plunge in November. The drop in orders for durables -- goods from bicycles to bombers that are expected to last at least three years -- was widespread. When military orders, a volatile category, are excluded, the decline was still a steep 5.4 percent. Shipments and order backlogs also fell. Mr. Greenspan, appearing before the committee to discuss banking and deposit insurance issues, was not asked specifically about the durable goods figures, which he presumably had seen. 'Our Options Are Open' But when asked by Donald W. Riegle Jr., a Michigan Democrat who heads the committee, whether interest rates would fall further, Mr. Greenspan, shunning direct comment, said, ""We're looking at the economy on a day-by-day basis -- and I would say our options are open."" At another point, he seemed to hint at the possibility of lower rates in response to a question about inflation, which ran at a relatively rapid pace early this year before subsiding in March. ""Do I see inflationary pressures in price levels and wage levels? I think we're doing rather well in that respect,"" he said. On the other hand, Mr. Greenspan warned that the risks of a wrong monetary policy decision are magnified at economic turning points, implying it would take more than poor durable-goods orders to prompt another rate cut. ""The issue of inflation is that it never surfaces visibly until it is well advanced,"" the chairman said. In sharp contrast to the guarded statements of Mr. Greenspan, some private analysts used strong language to characterize the latest drop in durables orders, which have fallen to the lowest point since August 1987. Douglas P. Handler, manager of economic analysis at Dun & Bradstreet, called the figures ""a horrible setback"" to those who believe the economy has already begun to revive, based mainly on some housing data. ""The magnitude of this drop-off is usually associated with the beginning of a recession rather than the end,"" Mr. Handler said. At an annual rate of $110.3 billion, which is adjusted for seasonal variation but not for inflation, orders for durables stand $7.3 billion, or 6.2 percent, below the February pace. The negligible February decline was revised to two-tenths of 1 percent from three-tenths of 1 percent. Among major industries, the biggest loss was a 10.8 percent drop in transportation equipment, with orders weakest for aircraft and parts. Electronic and other electrical machinery dropped 11.8 percent, roughly offsetting a February advance, while primary metals fell 2.6 percent. The exception was industrial machinery and equipment, which edged up seven-tenths of 1 percent. Within capital goods industries, new orders for nonmilitary goods fell 10.3 percent -- 5.5 percent not counting aircraft and parts. New orders for military capital goods fell 16.9 percent, the Commerce Department report also showed. Shipments Also Decline Meanwhile, shipments of durables fell for the fifth straight month, the 2.4 percent decline, to $114.7 billion, dragging them to the lowest level since February 1988. All major industries posted declines, the biggest a 3.9 percent drop for transportation equipment. Unfilled orders, a particularly good economic predictor, fell nine-tenths of 1 percent in March, to $502.3 billion, with all major industries declining here as well. New durables orders last month were 15.4 percent lower than in March 1990, the department also said.",1991-04-24 00:00:00,"4fd1a9ed8eb7c8105d6c7317","http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/24/business/greenspan-is-cautious-on-easing.html"

"There was something discordant, even tinny, about Barack Obama's attempt to castigate Wall Street last month. No doubt the president was trying to acknowledge and channel the resentments in his own party -- and in the country -- when he told CBS's Steve Kroft during a ''60 Minutes'' interview, ''I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers on Wall Street.'' Yet the rhetorical slap felt a little flat. In part it was the oddity of the epithet, a musty Washington cliché that had the effect of making Obama, the most urbane president in a half-century, sound as if he belonged in some black-and-white talkie from the '40s.

There is more talk of economic growth and job security as issues that should be higher on the national agenda than fighting inflation.

"A discordant note was sounded recently amid the steady chorus of good economic news. The index of leading economic indicators declined by six-tenths of 1 percent in January, which might lead someone to suppose that a recession lies around the corner. Immediately after that, total employment, an important ''coincident'' indicator that could signal a recession in progress, declined in February. And that bit of bearish news was followed on March 7 by a fall in the prime rate, an important lagging indicator, which might prove that a recession is already under way. To pessimists, it all adds up to a grim 1986 and beyond. In my view, however, that conclusion would be wrong and would go far to prove why we cannot put much credence in month-to-month blips in the indicators. It also calls into question the accuracy of the three economic indicators - leading, coincident and lagging - which were last updated in 1975.",1986-03-16 00:00:00,"4fd16d258eb7c8105d65f7d2","http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/16/business/a-revision-is-overdue-those-misleading-economic-indicators.html"

"The five main Democratic Presidential candidates agree with each other more than they disagree. All, for example, favor much more Federal involvement in areas like education and health. To one degree or another, they support grants or tax breaks to help develop specific industries. They emphasize more Government spending on what they call ""infrastructure"" -- highways, sewer systems, airports and the like. The Democrats also believe abortions should be basically unrestricted. But on the following issues, they take somewhat different approach. MAIN THEME Brown: The country's policies across the board are misguided because the system is corrupt and politicians are greedy. Clinton: The middle class has suffered most from the mistaken policies of the last 12 years, and that must be reversed. Harkin: Old fashioned liberalism is the wave of the future. Kerrey: The first step toward economic and social revival should be comprehensive national health insurance. Tsongas: The Government should work with business and not at cross purposes. TAXES Brown: Replace the existing income tax system with a flat, 13 percent tax on all income and a value-added tax, similar to a national sales tax, on business transactions. Deductions allowed only for mortgage interest, rent and charitable contributions. Temporary amnesty for tax evaders. Give business a tax cut for hiring workers from poor neighborhoods. Clinton: Cut income taxes of middle class by several hundred dollars a year and offset the cost with tax increases of unspecified size on those with incomes above $200,000. Cut capital gains tax for investment held at least five years in new businesses. Give investment tax credit to small and medium sized businesses. Expand earned income tax credit. Prohibit businesses from writing off the cost of excessive salaries and bonuses for executives. Harkin: Give no tax cut to middle class or reduction in capital gains tax. Provide investment tax credit for specified industries. Kerrey: Give two-year refundable tax credit worth 20 percent of Social Security and Medicare taxes, which would save a family earning $30,000 about $400 a year. Increase taxes by an unspecified amount on incomes above about $200,000. Allow tax credit for investments in plants and machinery. Cut capital gains tax by not taxing the part of the profit attributable to inflation. Impose a 4 percent payroll tax on employers and 1 percent on workers to pay for national medical insurance. Tsongas: Do not cut income taxes. Tax capital gains on profits from stocks at progressively lower rates depending on how long the stock is held and impose an even lower rate on gains from investments in small businesses. Raise income taxes on the wealthy. Increase the gasoline tax by 3 cents to 5 cents a gallon. Give temporary investment tax credit. Provide more favorable tax treatment of individual retirement accounts. MILITARY AFFAIRS Brown: Cut the military budget in half over the next five years. Clinton: Cut military spending by one-third over the next five years. Stop production of the B-2 bomber and the Star Wars missile defense system. Harkin: Reduce military spending and the size of the armed forces by half over the next 10 years. Cancel B-2 bomber but continue to develop weapons that might stimulate a useful commercial industry like the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft. Rely more on the National Guard and Reserves. Kerrey: Reduce military spending more than President Bush wants but avoid a meat-ax approach and be careful that the military is large enough and well enough equipped to meet any possible threat. Tsongas: Reduce military spending by an unspecified amount. Cut overseas bases rather than those at home. Require economic rivals like Japan and Germany to bear a larger share of the cost of their own defense. Stop selling weapons to third-world countries and persuade allies to do the same. HEALTH Brown: Install a national health insurance system that bypasses private insurance companies. Emphasize preventative care, ""acupuncture, chiropractic and wellness programs."" Clinton: Require employers to provide insurance coverage for workers or pay an additional tax into a public fund to cover the uninsured. Establish a Government board to regulate medical-care prices. Harkin: Bring labor, business and Government experts to a negotiating table to work out the best form of comprehensive national health insurance. Kerrey: Abolish Medicare, Medicaid and the existing employer-based insurance system. Pass revenue from new taxes to the states. Allow people to choose insurance from their state's plan or from private policies that meet minimum Federal standards. Pay the private companies a fixed amount based on the number of people they enroll. Have doctor and hospital fees set by the state governments. Tsongas. Enroll everyone in a group like the company where they work and provide a public plan for those who are not part of another group. Have private insurance companies and health maintenance organizations bid for contracts from the groups. Let sophisticated purchasing agents employed by the groups decide which plan is best for their members in terms of fees and services. TRADE Brown: Has not stressed this issue the way the other candidates have. Clinton: Says he is basically a free-trader. Blames the Japanese for about one-quarter of the United States's trade difficulty, and says this country should retaliate if Japan does not change its ways. Otherwise, says businesses, workers and the Government must work together to compete better in international commerce. Harkin: Supports tougher enforcement of existing trade laws and new forms of retaliation if necessary to force trading partners to open their markets to American goods. Voted against giving President Bush authority to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico. Kerrey: Favors whatever steps are needed to force other countries to open their markets. Voted to give the President authority to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico. Tsongas. Says trade restrictions are counterproductive. Believes the only way the United States can compete in international commerce is to improve the quality of its own products.

The government also said that companies compensated employees at a much higher rate than first calculated, which could add to pressure on businesses.",2007-03-07 00:00:00,"4fd275128eb7c8105d833d70","http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/07/business/07economy.html"

So I took a look at data from the Census Bureau, which conducts a quarterly survey of American spending habits.

There is much perplexity about the strength of protectionist sentiment in Congress - and much anxiety over the danger that, if it prevails, the United States would again provoke retaliation and start a trade war that would inflict grave damage on the economy of America and the world. Could this happen again, or has the danger been greatly overblown? Supporters of restrictive trade legislation today insist that they are not trying to start a trade war but seek only to protect American labor, industry and agriculture from unfair competition. What their intentions are and what the results would be, however, may be two different things. Most trade experts believe that the danger of serious protective measures taken by the United States is a real danger and that such measures could indeed spark some kind of trade war. But they add that its disastrous economic effects could be tempered if the United States and other countries undertake strong spending programs or other expansionary moves.",1985-09-17 00:00:00,"4fd15e678eb7c8105d6465cd","http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/17/business/protectionist-mood-mounting-pressure-smoot-and-hawley.html"

"In Washington last week there was much talk about the Administration's new economics. Equally evident in the numbers and the language of President Reagan's Budget Message and the Economic Report was his old philosophy. Roosevelt was traded for Rousseau and the New Deal ''safety net'' became the 18th-century moralist's ''social contract.'' But Mr. Reagan's guiding principle was one often cited in his Presidential campaigns: Government's first constitutional obligation is the national defense. His $848.5 billion proposal for Federal spending in the 1984 fiscal year includes a 10 percent increase for the Pentagon and a 14 percent reduction in social programs. A $189 billion deficit will be caused, Mr. Reagan's documents assert, not by the failure of his 1982 and 1983 plans. They proposed the correct means to right the ''longstanding structural imbalance'' that extended a simple social insurance system to ''vast networks of dependency'' while defense was permitted to fall to an ''intolerable state.'' But the economy's response was ''set two years behind schedule'' by an unanticipated ''prolonged recession in response to moderate monetary restraint'' (meaning the anti-inflationary policies of the Federal Reserve). Current ''modest'' economic assumptions show his 1984 plan will work - a point Mr. Reagan dramatized yesterday in his regular radio address by referring to the first drop in unemployment in 17 months - if Congress cooperates to cap health and other entitlement programs. If it does not, a tax increase would be needed in 1986.",1983-02-06 00:00:00,"4fd128ae8eb7c8105d5eff80","http://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/weekinreview/major-news-in-summary-reagan-tries-a-different-path-to-his-goals.html"
"Banks throughout the nation adopted a 15 percent prime rate yesterday, the third cut of half a percentage point in two weeks. The move to the lowest prime rate since November 1980 was spurred by dramatic declines in the cost of the banks' funds, reflecting a relaxation of the Federal Reserve Board's tight-money posture in the face of a weak economy and a slowing of the growth in the nation's money supply, analysts said. The Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh, the nation's 15th-largest bank, led the decline with its announcement Friday that it was cutting its prime rate from the 15 1/2 percent rate established a week ago. The prime - the base upon which banks compute interest charges on shortterm loans - started falling on July 19, when it stood at 16 1/2 percent, a level it had held since February.",1982-08-03 00:00:00,"4fd126c68eb7c8105d5ee151","http://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/03/business/banks-adopt-15-prime-cut-is-3d-in-two-weeks.html"

He has been quicker than Mr. Mondale to criticize the deployment of American troops in Lebanon, Grenada and Central America, just as he opposed the Vietnam War several years before Mr. Mondale. Mr. Hart says that he, like millions of college students in the 1960's, learned ''the lessons of Vietnam,'' including the ''futility'' of military intervention. Mr. Mondale retorts that ''guilt is not a foreign policy'' and that the United States must be ready to use its military strength because the world is ''a tough, dangerous place'' where ''the enemies of freedom win power by force.''",1984-03-30 00:00:00,"4fd133268eb7c8105d602023","http://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/30/us/democratic-presidential-aspirants-view-key-issues-despite-campaign-oratory-some.html"

"Nothing in this election season, no program or party or politician, is less popular than the Troubled Asset Relief Program of 2008 -- a k a the Wall Street bailout. No policy has fewer public figures willing to defend it, and fewer Americans who believe it worked. No issue has done more to stoke the fires of populist backlash, and the rage against elites. It was TARP that first turned Tea Partiers against Republican incumbents, and independents against Washington. It was TARP that steadily undermined Barack Obama's agenda, by making activist government seem like a game rigged to benefit privileged insiders. And it is TARP that's spurred this campaign cycle's only outbreak of bipartisanship: as of September, Politico's Ben Smith noted recently, the two parties had combined to spend about $80 million on attack ads that invoke the bailout, with the Democrats alone accounting for $53 million of that spending.",2010-10-25 00:00:00,"4fd2aa6d8eb7c8105d896258","http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/25/opinion/25douthat.html"

"THE idea, on its face, is very appealing: now is the time to levy a tax on imported oil because it will provide needed income to offset some of the Federal deficit, and the bite on consumers will be more like a nibble while oil prices are falling. Not entirely unexpectedly, Senator Pete V. Domenici, a long-time supporter of the idea, is expected to introduce a bill this week to levy a $10-a-barrel tax on imported petroleum and refined products. The only exemption, according to the New Mexico Republican's staff, would be for crude oil that is imported and then refined for immediate export. The tax program would permit the President, subject only to a twohouse veto, to adjust the tax rate up or down in $2.50 increments. There is only one problem. So far President Reagan has been inhospitable to the idea of taxing imported oil, preferring instead to see cheaper oil help the fledgling economic recovery, which with luck and a further decline in oil prices, could be in full swing in the 1984 election year.",1983-03-07 00:00:00,"4fd12c148eb7c8105d5f5ec7","http://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/07/business/washington-watch-oil-tax-deficit-and-recovery.html"

After the end of the old welfare system was legislated, time-limited help for the needy was enacted, with more than three in four eligible families benefiting in 1996. But by 2000, only half the eligible families were receiving this aid, for reasons not fully plumbed as government officials continue to simplistically trumpet the drop in the welfare caseload.

"In the face of evidence that the recession is still deepening, President Reagan and his economic advisers are predicting that the economy will turn around and grow strongly and inflation will slow in the second half of 1982 and later. The rationale behind this optimistic forecast, as detailed in the Economic Report written by the President's Council of Economic Advisers, is that the Administration has found the solution to the major economic problem that has dogged the United States and the rest of the industrial world for the past decade - ''stagflation,'' the mixture of economic stagnation with high unemployment and high inflation. The basic solution, as proposed in the Economic Report, is the Administration's well-advertised two-way remedy, which combines strict control of the growth of the money supply to cure inflation with huge tax cuts to cure stagnation. The report attempts to demonstrate that ''what some people refer to as 'monetarism' and 'supply-side' economics should be seen as two sides of the same coin - compatible and necessary measures to both reduce inflation and increase economic growth.''",1982-02-11 00:00:00,"4fd11e388eb7c8105d5dd1ec","http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/business/an-economic-cure-controlling-money-and-cutting-taxes-economic-analysis.html"

The climate of economic uncertainty, however, can create some real opportunities for the nimble investor.

"To the Editor: It was gratifying to learn that Donald Fites of Caterpillar believes that increases in living standards of people in poor countries require some constraints on resource use by people in rich countries. Inevitably, however, that approach has limitations. For example, the real wages of Caterpillar workers have declined. Have Caterpillar executives sacrificed along with their workers? And what insures that workers in the developing world benefit as the United States standard of living declines? Mexican workers, mentioned by Mr. Fites, suffered a 3.5 percent average yearly decline from 1980 to 1987. Having American incomes ""tread water"" while developing-country workers catch up, as Mr. Fites proposes, is not necessary if we pursue rising living standards in environmentally sustainable and community-enhancing ways.

Several prominent economists said that the recovery will sustain its momentum into the first half of next year. Most agreed that the expansion will slow near the middle of 1984, as continuing high interest rates reduce the growth of consumer and corporate spending. But on balance, the economists said that the nation is in for another year of economic well being.

"Two black economists today debated whether preferential treatment helps or hinders blacks in what was a rare presentation of fundamental differences at a meeting of a major civil rights organization. The discussion, at the National Urban League's annual conference here, pointed up a renewed controversy among black leaders and organizations over demands for racial quotas, affirmative action programs and other devices making it easier for blacks to gain entry to universities, jobs and business deals that had been closed to them in the past. Such programs could ''destroy the possibility of attaining 'real' equality of status for black Americans,'' said one of the economists, Glenn C. Loury, a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. He argued against the use of racial quotas and against what he said was the ''inappropriate'' use of ''civil rights strategies'' in dealing with problems such as low educational achievement among blacks.",1985-07-25 00:00:00,"4fd1502c8eb7c8105d63150d","http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/25/us/urban-league-hears-debate-on-quotas-for-blacks.html"

"On a recent morning in Manhattan, a friend of mine walked into his bank, carrying his briefcase. He went up to the teller's window and asked to withdraw thousands of dollars of his savings, which the teller handed over in $100 bills. He then walked home, holding his briefcase a little more tightly than usual, and put his money in a drawer. Was he being a little paranoid? He knew that he was. His savings were guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which, as government officials have been reminding us lately, has never failed to cover a bank deposit in its 70 years of existence. Cash in a drawer comes with no such guarantee. If there's a house fire, the money is gone. But my friend figured that even if his savings were at no real risk of disappearing at the bank, they might become unavailable to him for some period of weeks or months, were the financial crisis to keep worsening. He didn't like that idea. So he was willing to give up a few months of interest -- meager interest, to be sure -- in exchange for a sense of control.

"CONGRESS has passed and President Bush has signed legislation to rescue the economy from the jaws of recession. The $168 billion package, which includes an effort to increase consumer spending by distributing $600 rebates to individuals, can be faulted in many ways: with two wars and a budget deficit the nation can't really afford it; it will probably arrive too late in the business cycle to actually make a difference; and the near-universal aspect of the rebates doesn't make much sense. But the most fundamentally troubling thing is the premise that while consumer overspending got us into this mess, more will get us out of it. This is akin to the old saw about curing a hangover with the hair of the dog that bit you. What if instead of giving rebates we helped create an investor society by seeding universal investment accounts? This would not only pump cash into the economy, through the slightly more indirect route of investment, it would also help us correct some of the near-fatal flaws in our long-term economic landscape.",2008-02-22 00:00:00,"4fd2768c8eb7c8105d8373ac","http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/opinion/22conley.html"

Or was the rise of short-term money-market rates on Thursday and Friday merely a brief reversal in what will emerge within a month or two as a continuing downward trend?

This is in sharp contrast to the problems that oil brought to Western economies after the Iranian revolution two and a half years ago.

Government statistics show that the abundance of oil is already slowing inflation, aiding economic growth and cutting the United States trade deficit to the slimmest total in more than five years.

Jostens, an industry leader, said yearbook sales rose to $300 million from last year's $280 million. With the selling year now at an end, total ring sales were about $208 million, according to L.G.

"The Clinton administration released projections last week showing that the estimated federal surplus will hit $5 trillion over the next 10 years, almost $1 trillion more than previously expected. Supporters of President-elect George W. Bush say that the bigger surplus now expected will provide the wherewithal to pass Mr. Bush's proposed $1.9 trillion tax cut, which the Bush team believes is needed to spur an economy that is slowing down. But a careful look at the numbers shows that the Bush plan remains a bad fiscal idea. Start with the fact that $2.5 trillion of the projected surplus comes from Social Security and another $500 billion or so comes from Medicare. Both pots of money are essentially off limits. Congress appears committed to using the extra money from these programs to pay down the federal debt -- a use that does not affect the solvency of either program but does improve the overall health of the future economy.

"The recession seems to be ending. But the overwhelming consensus is that the recovery will not amount to much. There is talk of a ""double dip"" downturn, and few expect strong growth. The stock market, however, seems to have a different opinion, That contrary notion, of coming strength in the economy, is conveyed not just by the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average last week rose 113.59 points, to 3,027.50, setting a record and closing above 3,000 for the first time since April 17. It may also be significant that it is no longer the recession-resistant consumer stocks, like Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris, that are leading the charge. Of the 30 stocks in the Dow, four are now at least 10 percent higher than they were when the average first closed over 3,000. All are big, grimy, cyclical stocks: Du Pont, Goodyear, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel. International Paper and Union Carbide have risen almost as much. If those moves are to make sense, then this economy needs than a weak recovery. The bond market's refusal to rally may also be sending a signal of surprising economic strength,. The Federal Reserve has pushed short-term interest rates dopwn sharply, and American investors have taken the hint. Sales of mutural funds are booming. And yet, as Fred Leiner, an economist at Continental Bank, points out, long-term interest rates have been stalled for six months, making minor moves but essentially going sideways. ""I'm concerned by some similarities with late 1986,"" he said. ""We see money pouring into bond funds, yet the bond market is unable to move higher. Those similarities suggest the market may move lower from these levels."" In late 1986 and early 1987, he recalled, the bond market stalled while stocks leaped. Then bond prices crashed in the spring, and stock prices followed the fall. This year, there are certainly plenty of reasons to doubt that the economy can rebound strongly. The debt overhang that helped to bring on this recession has not disappeared, and the Government's efforts to fight the recession have been limited by the severe fiscal problems brought on by the profligacy of the 1980's. It is hard to imagine a new boom in commercial construction. Moreover, the evidence that the recession is ending, while persuasive to a lot of stock traders, is still limited,. The leading indicators have risen for three consecutive months, and factory orders turned up in April. Consumers tell pollsters the present is bad, but the future will be better, and they seem to translate those beliefs into cautious spending, not a panicky increase in savings. Stock market analysts note that secondary stocks, which were leaders in the winter rally, are lagging as summer begins, Their particiaption would make this rally a more impressive one. But for all that, it is a fact that the economy usually finds a way to surprise the seers. A strong recovery this year would certianly qualify as a surprise.

"President Reagan returned from an 11-day California vacation today, with political strategists saying he needs quick, clear signs of economic improvement to protect the Republican Party from election losses this fall. They say the potential losses could be serious enough to jeopardize his precarious political coalition in Congress over the next two years. To most people, the fall elections still seem far off, but Republican and Democratic strategists believe the economy has reached a critical period for the outcome of the election. Because experience indicates a lag of three or four months until an economic improvement has a broad impact on voters, Democratic poll takers like Peter Hart say it is already too late for the Republicans. Republican pollsters like Robert Teeter and even White House officials assert that Republicans need a clear improvement in the next month or six weeks to have any political benefits.",1982-07-12 00:00:00,"4fd122dd8eb7c8105d5e5e9d","http://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/12/us/analysts-say-gop-needs-quick-signs-of-economic-gains.html"

"IT wasn't so surprising that when the National League of Cities gathered in Detroit last week, President Reagan's ''new federalism'' came in for plenty of flak. What was surprising perhaps was the intensity of the bipartisan attack. New York's Democratic Mayor Koch said the Administration's program to give local governments responsibility for scores of programs once supervised and largely underwritten by Washington was a ''sham and a shame.'' But many officials, some once regarded as influential supporters of the President, also complained bitterly about the financial strains on local governments. The League's departing president, Mayor William H. Hudnut 3d of Indianapolis, regarded as a Reagan ally not long ago, said ''too much has been asked of cities and other recipients of these Federal programs.'' Gov. Richard A. Snelling of Vermont, a conservative Republican who heads the National Governors Association, emerged as a leading critic of the ''new federalism'' as practiced so far. He said it was leading the nation toward ''an economic Bay of Pigs.'' (As an example of the effects, Pennsylvania, on Dec.12, was to begin trimming welfare aid to families with dependent children in accordance with new Federal guidelines.) B. Drummond Ayres Jr., a Washington correspondent of The New York Times, conducted separate interviews last week with Governor Snelling and with the Administration's chief defender of the program, Richard S.

Excluding housing, which many critics say is improperly treated and measured by the index, the May rise was the same as the four-tenths of 1 percent increase recorded by the index in April.

"THE recent bleak returns on Wall Street have ushered in a period of accord among investment advisers.

While the strategists may differ somewhat on how weak the economy will become -- or indeed, whether it is already in a recession -- they generally expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates substantially this year.

"CHICAGO ALITTLE more than a year ago, Martin S. Feldstein, Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, vetoed the Reagan Administration's evolving economic forecast. He told his fellow Presidential advisers that the United States economy would not grow at a 4.4 percent clip over the next 12 months - 3 to 3.5 percent was more likely. Many of Mr. Feldstein's fellow economists agreed with his caution. High interest rates, the looming budget deficit, sickly foreign economies - all mitigated against a strong recovery. Or so they warned. But they were wrong. The economy came roaring back, so strongly that only a firm tug on the monetary reins by the Federal Reserve has held real growth to an annual rate of 6.5 percent since the recovery began last winter - which tracks with virtually every economic recovery since World War II. The recession of 1981-82 may have been the worst by many measures since the Great Depression, but this first year of recovery has been remarkably average. If it were to continue average, the recovery would last another two to four years.",1983-11-20 00:00:00,"4fd12f6b8eb7c8105d5fba96","http://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/business/a-classic-recovery-after-all.html"

"DURING the cold war, as the Soviet economic system slowly unraveled, internal reform was impossible because highly placed officials who recognized the systemic disorders could not talk about them honestly. The United States is now in an equivalent predicament. Its weakening position in the global trading system is obvious and ominous, yet leaders in politics, business, finance and the news media are not willing to discuss candidly what is happening and why. Instead, they recycle the usual bromides about the benefits of free trade and assurances that everything will work out for the best. Much like Soviet leaders, the American establishment is enthralled by utopian convictions -- the market orthodoxy of free trade globalization. The United States is heading for yet another record trade deficit in 2005, possibly 25 percent larger than last year's. Our economy's international debt position -- accumulated from many years of tolerating larger and larger trade deficits -- began compounding ferociously in the last five years. Our net foreign indebtedness is now more than 25 percent of gross domestic product and at the current pace will reach 50 percent in four or five years .",2005-07-18 00:00:00,"4fd24d618eb7c8105d7ed9ee","http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/18/opinion/18greider.html"

As foreign travel to the United States rises by about 10 percent this year and Americans' overseas travel falls by roughly 25 percent because of fears about terrorism, ''the economy will get a boost of about one-half of 1 percent in the third quarter,'' said Martin Mauro, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics, who predicts third-quarter annual growth of real gross national product will be 4 percent. The rise in domestic tourism will also help reduce America's net export deficit, which weighed in at an annual rate of $130.3 billion in the first quarter.

"COMPANIES Networks Learn What Happens If They Leave the Chicken Coop Open Yes, television keeps reinventing itself, but some things have stayed constant since the beginning of time (i.e., the beginning of television). Even with upstarts like HBO and CNN, the networks that came over on the Mayflower are still the heavies. The power of CBS, NBC and ABC has eroded, but only now does this trinity suddenly seem shaky. Last week Fox, which recently jolted the big guns by nabbing some serious television fare -- pro football -- had the audacity to take 12 stations away from them, 8 from CBS alone, by agreeing to invest $500 million in New World Communications. Of course, the old-liners can get new stations in the markets involved -- big-time places like Dallas, Detroit and Atlanta. But they could well be relegated (horrors!) to the boondocks north of channel 13. And the reaction of a bloodied CBS: ""The war is started,"" said Howard Stringer, head of the CBS Broadcast Group. For Gerber, a Way to Grow Gerber had a problem. It dominated this country's baby food market, but with a declining birth rate there were fewer little mouths -- and no way for the company to grow. But Sandoz wanted the chance to branch out from pharmaceuticals -- not to mention that Swiss companies have been rushing to make acquisitions before Jan. 1, when a change in accounting methods makes acquisitions less desirable. So last week the two found each other, as Sandoz bid $3.7 billion for Gerber -- a high price, suggesting that Nestle was also interested. (Of course it was just coincidence that Gerber stock options were very active the Friday before the deal was announced.) Simplifying With a Vengeance I.B.M. wants to simplify its life. That's what its new-broom chairman, Louis Gerstner, clearly thinks is needed to get this scattered giant on the right and future track. There's talk of a ""unified image,"" of offering customers ""seamless, easy solutions that tie products together."" But when I.B.M. simplifies, put on your seat belt. Last week it abruptly dismissed more than 40 ad agencies, giving the work to a single agency, Ogilvy & Mather. I.B.M. spends up to $500 million a year selling itself, making this the biggest account migration in ad history. Madison Avenue is still picking up the pieces. For Denny's, Bias Is Costly Despite all the progress, no one would pretend that racial bias has been wiped out. But the indignities that remain, both large and small, are often hard to pin down -- and even harder to punish. But according to the Justice Department, Denny's, the restaurant chain, was so blatant and consistent in its bias that a solid case could be built. Perhaps the decisive straw came when six black Secret Service agents assigned to President Clinton were refused a table. And this wasn't random bias, said one lawyer in the case, but ""an attitude that went into the management level."" Last week Denny's agreed to pay $54 million to settle lawsuits by thousands of black customers. (Those who feel they should share in this can call 800 836-0055.) They Know When You Slurp A fast-food restaurant would seem an ideal spot to impart state secrets or steamy gossip. It's anonymous, generic, so much a part of the landscape that it's practically invisible. Think again. Last week it turned out that Dunkin' Donuts -- along with who knows how many other businesses -- hides microphones in its stores to monitor cashiers and clerks. But of course that means everyone's on tape, customer and employee alike. It gives a whole new meaning to the concept of public dining. ""It's surprising and scary,"" said Lewis Maltby of the American Civil Liberties Union. 214 Miles for an Electric Car Electric cars will never make it. Everyone knows that. They just can't go far enough between meals. Then again, look at those cars guzzling unthinkable amounts of gas, and belching out unthinkable clouds of gunk, at the Indianapolis 500 today. They're lucky to go 100 miles between pit stops. Electric cars, by comparison, are becoming virtual long-distance runners. Last week at the American Tour de Sol, a race for electric and solar-powered cars, a Geo Metro converted by Solectria cruised 214.2 miles without stopping -- no doubt a world record. INTERNATIONAL Tiananmen Square: It's History Did President Clinton really have any choice when he renewed China's favorable trading status last week? Probably not; our trade with China has become so vast that a mere politician would be hard pressed to slow it down. Look at the numbers: $31 billion of Chinese goods come to the United States yearly; $9 billion worth take the return route. Some people wished the President had stuck to a hard line on human rights, but Mr. Clinton -- sounding eerily like George Bush -- insisted that even though China had not made the progress he'd sought, more could be accomplished by not isolating this giant nation. The message seems to be this: the statute of limitations is up on Tiananmen Square. Playing the Antitrust Card Washington can rattle its sabers at foreign companies whose practices hurt our exports, but it may do no good. Last week it tried a new tactic, filing an antitrust suit against the British glass maker Pilkington, saying it hoarded glass-making technology; Pilkington quickly settled. America's jurisdiction? Simple. Pil kington has big holdings here. This approach could leave a lot of global companies open, for it's nearly impossible to do business here without putting down some roots. THE ECONOMY Data for All (Except the Poor) Under your feet, over your head and in the wilds of cyberspace, the information highway is relentlessly taking shape. But now some concerned citizens are saying, Wait a second! You've forgotten something. As phone companies plan their fancy networks linking video, voice and computer, they're guilty of ""electronic redlining,"" bypassing poor areas and focusing on better-heeled tekkies -- that's the message of a study released last week by consumer and civil rights groups. While the industry insists that it's laying paths where the users are -- that it had to start somewhere -- critics say there have to be rules. Data highway, meet political reality. Now, States Take On Tobacco ""The free ride is over,"" said Mississippi's Attorney General as he announced a suit against 13 tobacco companies to recover the state's costs of treating smoking-related illnesses -- and to stop Joe Camel-type ads. ""It's time these billionaire tobacco companies start paying what they rightfully owe."" Of course, no one's ever gotten a penny from suing the tobacco industry -- it's always argued that smoking is a matter of choice -- but this is the first time a state, not an individual, has tried. And the state's assertion that tobacco companies long knew of smoking's hazards has more weight now, after the disclosure of documents backing that up. . . . And no sooner had Mississippi acted than Florida went a step further, enacting a law specifically to allow suits on behalf of Medicaid patients who smoke. Calming Words on Derivatives Most people still don't understand what derivatives are, but there's a gnawing sense that these speculative gadgets -- contracts ""derived"" from things like stocks or currencies -- constitute some sort of ""black hole"" that could inhale the financial universe. Well, last week scientists said there really are black holes, but on the financial front the sky-is-falling crowd got a setback. After a congressional study calling for far more scrutiny of derivatives, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, came on stage and said, in effect, Don't worry. There's ""negligible"" risk, he said, that this fast-growing market could create a monster that could rattle the Republic. The Tortoise Economy Slow and steady, slow and steady -- that's what the numbers keep showing. Fitting right into this last week was a report that April durable-goods orders rose just 0.1 percent, still treading water after surging in late 1993. The trend could also be seen in final G.D.P. figures showing a 3 percent first-quarter growth rate (revised upward from 2.6), after that strong 7 percent pace at the end of last year. Home resales did rise strongly in April, but an awful lot of people surely sensed that the glory days of low mortgage rates may be over.",1994-05-29 00:00:00,"4fd1be298eb7c8105d6eb8d9","http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/business/business-diary.html"

The auto, oil and housing industries are expected to lead the earnings retreat, dragging other sectors of the economy closely behind. ''What is most disconcerting,'' said Gail I. Hessol, vice president for industrial ratings at Standard & Poor's Corporation, ''is that just about any of the industries or companies we deal with have business forecasts that assume a recovery for the second half of 1982.

The 33.7 percent increase from June's figures was the largest in the 23 years that records have been kept.

When Treasury bonds reached a yield of more than 13 percent yesterday, analysts said that speculative buyers emerged, raising the price of the issue about 2 3/8 points, to 98 7/8. The yield on the bellwether 12 3/4 percent Treasury bond, due in 2010, fell to 12.89 percent from Monday's peak of 13.39 percent.",1981-04-08 00:00:00,"4fd1231f8eb7c8105d5e6f3f","http://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/08/business/credit-markets-rates-dip-as-traders-maneuver.html"

"Rudolph G. Penner, director of the Congressional Budget Office, told Congress today that he thought economic growth next year would be slower and the Federal budget deficit larger than President Reagan's 1986 budget estimated. Mr. Penner told the Senate Budget Committee that his office's re-estimates of the President's budget's deficit, due in late February, ''certainly will be higher'' because C.B.O. analysts expect higher interest rates and less economic growth. Higher rates would make the interest on the national debt more costly; lower growth would mean less tax revenue. Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, said the deficit projections for 1988 and 1990 could be in the $165 billion to $175 billion range, rather than showing a decline as estimated by the Administration. The President, in the budget he released this week, projected that if all his $47.5 billion of spending cuts were approved the deficit would decline to $144 billion in 1988 and $82 billion in 1990.

"Senator John McCain offered the broadest look yet at his economic policies in a speech on Tuesday in Pittsburgh, outlining a series of tax reductions and backing away from his pledge to balance the budget by the end of his first term. The speech, delivered on the deadline for filing taxes, afforded the clearest view to date of what McCainomics might look like. There was a dash of populism, as Mr. McCain criticized executive pay and corporate wrongdoing. There was a strong supply-side bent, with Mr. McCain focusing on cutting corporate taxes and making permanent the Bush tax cuts that he once opposed. And there was a decidedly less hawkish note on deficits, as Mr. McCain called for spending cuts but did not mention balancing the federal budget.",2008-04-16 00:00:00,"4fd283248eb7c8105d850fee","http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/us/politics/16mccain.html"

"On Monday the public had its first taste of what could be a yearly gold mine of information about America: the Census 2000 Supplemental Survey. Conducted between late 1999 and early this year, the supplement reports responses from 700,000 households to questions similar to those asked in the ''long form'' census of 2000. The newly released figures bring much of the good news to be expected from a decadelong boom. Americans earned more, saw their material wealth burgeon and obtained more education to guarantee their futures. But the supplement also exposes some areas that beg for improvement. Even in the world's leading economy, over half a million homes still lack complete plumbing. Though the poverty rate for adults is 11 percent, the rate among children under 18 is 17 percent. Only 11 percent of the elderly are poor, a testament to the efficacy of Social Security and Medicare. The federal government does not provide a similar safety net for children.",2001-08-09 00:00:00,"4fd2593d8eb7c8105d80563b","http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/09/opinion/new-numbers-to-crunch.html"
"The nation's Roman Catholic bishops today ended a key meeting at which they took several steps toward uniting behind an ambitious campaign to influence public policy. Many believe that their chances for success, however, rest on an effective strategy of activism that the bishops concede has yet to be developed. The focus of the four-day annual session of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops was a proposed pastoral letter that takes a sharply critical view of the American economy. Though the 280 bishops discussed a first draft only briefly, they appeared to be solidly in support of its main contentions. Even before its expected adoption in modified form at next year's meeting, the statement on the economy was already acclaimed here as a third plank in a major platform on which the bishops say they will try to change minds and laws. With the two other issues, opposition to abortion and to nuclear arms, they say they have just begun to march.",1984-11-16 00:00:00,"4fd13c1c8eb7c8105d61220d","http://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/16/us/bishops-agenda-turning-pastoral-letters-into-public-policy.html"
